1 basic sweet dough 1 pound fat (butter, lard, or lard sub-

1 pound sugar stitute)

1 pound raisins


Work all other ingredients thoroughly into the sweet dough, roll
out about Y 2 inch thick, and place in any kind of pan available.
Allow to rise at 80° F. for about 30 minutes, or until the dough
has about doubled in size. Bake in medium oven (325°-400° F.-12
to 16 counts) 20 to 30 minutes, or until done. To determine when
baked, raise edge to see whether under side is done. After baking,
cool and add plain icing or, instead of icing, sprinkle top with sugar
and cinnamon just before placing in oven.
