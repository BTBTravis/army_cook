world over as a fine art, and a good cook always commands respect.
Cooks who perfect themselves in their art are always in demand, and

same old way day after day may be entirely wholesome at all times,
but they fail to arouse the interest of those who meet them at the table.
On the other hand, more than any other factor, poorly cooked meals
will breed discontent and will lower morale.
