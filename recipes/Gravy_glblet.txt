This should be made only when poultry is roasted or fried. Chop
the cooked gizzards, hearts, and livers of the fowls and add to a
cream gravy made from the drippings.

125* Gravy, stock

10 quarts stock 2 gallons water

2 pounds flour


Heat the stock to the boiling point and sift in the flour slowly,
stirring constantly. If a brown gravy is desired, continue cooking
until the flour is browned, then add the water and continue cooking
and stirring until of the desired thickness, but if white gravy is de-
sired do not brown the flour. Season with salt and pepper. Serve
hot. This gravy should be made only when drippings or frying are
not available.
