THE ARMY COOK


Bring the salted water to a boil, then add sugar and hominy, and
boil for about 20 minutes or until tender. Remove to the back part
of the range and let simmer for about 40 minutes. (A double boiler
is preferable. One can be made by inserting the boiler containing
the hominy into a large boiler.) Serve with butter or sirup.
