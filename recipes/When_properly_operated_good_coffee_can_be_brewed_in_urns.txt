by using urn bags, Tricolator, Dripolator, or other brewing
devices. But usually equipment of this kind does not pro-
duce good coffee unless used to its normal capacity. It does
not provide the fiexibility to conform with varying troop
strength.

Small batches of 5 gallons of coffee cannot be made satis-
factorily in equipment designed to make large 20- or 40-
gallon batches. In such cases the insufficient quantity of
dry ground coffee in relation to the diameter of the dry
coffee compartment allows the water to go through it too
quickly, resulting in a weak brew. On the other hand, if
the diameter of a drip device is too small for the amount
of dry coffee used, the depth of grounds in the device re-
tards the free flow of water so that overextraction results.
