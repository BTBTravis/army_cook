that 8 ounces of bread, soft, and 4 ounces of flour will be the component in lieu of the flour component.

purchase of any desired kind of food. For example, if a company
mess had a strength of 100 men on July 1 and the value of the ration
for July is 30 cents, the quartermaster gives the mess credit for $30.
The mess may purchase food from the quartermaster up to a value
of $30; or if it purchases less than $30 worth, it is entitled to the
saving in cash. This is called the ration savings privilege. The
cash savings go into the company fund and may be spent at any
later date for food. For convenience, the accounts are settled by
the quartermaster once a month.
