recipes found in other cookbooks due to the fact that all recipes are
not suitable for an Army mess. However, a good cook will always
be on the alert to discover additional recipes from commercial cook-

The quantity required for a greater or smaller number of men can
be easily figured by changing the amount of each ingredient pro-

( 1 ) Breakfast dishes.

(2) Soups.

(3) Meat dishes (includes poultry, game, and omelets).

(4) Gravies and sauces.

(5) Fish and seafood dishes.

(6) Vegetable dishes.

(7) Desserts.

(8) Sweet-dough products.

(9) Hot breads.

(10) Rolls.

(11) Salads and dressings.

(12) Beverages.
