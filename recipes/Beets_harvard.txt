THE ARMY COOK


If fresh beets are used, clean and boil until tender, then drain
and remove skins and roots. Cut the beets into thin slices or cubes.
Sift together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt, mix with the vinegar,
and boil this sauce 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent scorch-
ing. Add the butter and, when melted and stirred in, pour the sauce
over the beets which should be heated if cold. Let stand a few min-
utes to absorb the sweet-sour flavor of the sauce.

Serve alone as an additional vegetable, or with meats. If served
with meats, use one-half of this recipe.
