10 iK&gt;und8 beef scraps of any kind 1 gallon beef stock
14 pounds bread 1 ounce sage

2 pounds onions, chopped Salt and pepper to taste

Run the meat scraps through a chopper, soak the bread in cold
water and remove excess water by squeezing. Mix the meat and
bread with the onions, season with sage to taste, add sufficient beef
stock to make about the same consistency as hash, and spread 2 or 3
inches deep over the bottom of a well-greased pan. Spread a little
grease over the top and bake for 40 minutes in a medium oven
(325°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts). Serve hot with meat and gravy.

Do not leave on the stove as this causes the dressing to become dry
and hard.
