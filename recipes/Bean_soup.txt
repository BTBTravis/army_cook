3 pounds beans, dry 1% pounds bacon, diced and browned

7 gallons water or beef stock 2 cans tomatoes (No. 2% or No. 3 cans)

Thoroughly clean and wash the beans. Place them and the soup
bone in the beef stock and allow to simmer for about 5 hours, or until
the beans have gone to pieces and will pass through a colander. Ten
minutes before serving add the tomatoes, the diced and browned
bacon, and enough beef stock to make 10 gallons of soup. Thicken
with a flour batter and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve
hot with crackers or croutons.
