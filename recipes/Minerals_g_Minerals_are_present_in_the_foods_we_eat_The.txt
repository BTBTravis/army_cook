amounts are so small it is impossible to see them but they are abso-
lutely necessary for good health. They may be classified as both pro-
tective and building substances. Calcium is the mineral most likely
to be deficient in ordinary meals unless thought and action are taken
to see that it is supplied.

a. Calcium and phosphorus are necessary for strong, firm bones
and teeth, and to maintain the tone of various tissues. The richest
sources of calcium and phosphorus are milk, eggs, cheese, and some
green leafy vegetables.

h. Iron and copper help promote growth and prevent anemia. Iron
and copper are found in liver, lean meat, egg yolk, apricots, green
leafy vegetables, and whole grain cereals.

c. Iodine is needed for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland
in the throat. Without it, the disease of common goiter may occur.
Iodine is found in sea foods and in the water supply and vegetables
grown in nongoiterous regions. In goiterous areas iodized salt may
be used to supply the necessary iodine.

d. Several other inorganic mineral elements are also essential. They
are present in many of the foods people eat and there is little danger
of not obtaining enough of them. If milk, vegetables and fruits, lean
meats, fish, eggs, whole grain breads, and cereals are included in the
daily diet, all of the mineral requirements can be fulfilled.
