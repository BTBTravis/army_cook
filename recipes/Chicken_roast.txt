Chicken_roast

75 pounds chicken, dressed, undrawn 15 pounds bread crumbs
4 pounds onions, minced, browned 2 pounds flour
2 pounds fat, butter preferred

Singe, then clean the chicken well, saving heart, liver, and gizzard,
which should be cooked and then minced for use in gravy or dressing.
To make the dressing, moisten the bread crumbs with water, mix with
onions and giblets, and season with pepper and saft, sage, thyme, or
other spices. The bread may be soaked in oyster liquor and oysters
added to the dressing. Celery, currants, or raisins may be used in-
stead of onions. Lemon juice or nuts may be added. This dressing
may be used with any fowl or fish. Stuff the chicken well with dress-
ing. Sew up with strong thread and tie wings down to the body.
Make a batter with the flour and fat, season with salt and pepper,
and rub the chicken with it before placing in oven. Koast in a slow
oven (200®-250° F. g 18 to 20 counts). After the chicken has been
in the oven about 20 minutes, add a little hot water and baste every
15 minutes until done. This generally requires about 2^ hours,
depending upon the quality of the fowl. Last few minutes of cook-
ing should be at a high heat to brown the outside of the chicken.
Carve and serve hot with gravy.
