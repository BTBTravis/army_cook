from this bone. Now remove the tail bone, then the aitchbone. Trim

loose meat from the boneless rump so that the resulting rump butt
will be a smooth, blocky piece of meat.

(19) The trimmed loin is on the block, meat side down. The
tenderloin should be removed first (fig. 12, point 1). To do this run
the knife close along the chine bone, then starting at either the rump
or rib end (whichever is most convenient, depending upon whether
the loin is from the right or left side) strip the tenderloin, with
the aid of the knife, from the inside of the loin. Cut close to the

finger bones and hip bone, leaving no more meat than is necessary
on these bones.

(20) The loin end can now be separated from the short loin.
Cut through the meat from the top side of the loin immediately
in front of the hip bone. Saw through the backbone to finish divid-
ing these two wholesale cuts (fig. 12, dotted line de). With practice
this separation can be made without a saw by making a cut with
the knife between the sacral and lumbar vertebrae, then breaking
the backbone over the edge of the block.

(21) The hip bone and backbone may be removed from the loin
end in one piece. The first step is to cut along the feather or spine
bones on the top side. Turn the piece over and cut closely around
the hip bone, then the backbone. Continue cutting until all the
meat has been loosened from these bones. Trim off loose pieces
of meat so that the boneless sirloin butt will be a smooth, neat-
looking cut of meat when you are through with it.

(22) The easiest way to remove the bones from the shell loin
(short loin with tenderloin out) is to separate the meat from the
feather or spine bones first. One continuous cut with a sharp knife
is all that will be necessary. Cut close to the feather bones the full
length of the loin. Now turn the shell loin on edge so that it rests
oh the backbone. With the aid of the knife, separate the loin meat
from the finger bones. The meat which remains attached to the
backbone is the most difficult to remove. This is where a good
sharp boning knife comes in handy. By carefully weaving the tip
of the knife around the processes of the vertebrae, most of the meat
can be detached from the bone and left on the loin strip. Cut the
flank meat from the loin strip on a line with the edge of the eye
muscle.

/. Beef cuts and their uses . g ^The wide variety of boneless cuts
from the side of beef may be used in a number of different ways.
Generally speaking, however, the most satisfactory results in cooking
will be obtained by using the tender cuts for roasts and steaks and
the less tender cuts for such dishes as pot roasts and stews, and
in ground form for meat loaf, patties, and chili. When buying
forequarters and hindquarters alternately it is often a good idea to
save the spencer roll (and chuck roll, if needed) from the fore-
quarter, to cook with the tender cuts from the hindquarter. The heel
and outside round from the hindquarter can be held back to cook
with the less tender forequarter cuts.. The following table shows
the use recommended for the various boneless beef cuts :

g. Beef cutting test . g No two sides of beef are exactly alike, and no
two men cut meat exactly the same way. As a result the figures given
here will not be identical to the yields you may expect in your
kitchen; but the following table will give a close approximation of
the number of pounds of meat you may expect from forequarters and
hindquarters of beef weighing from 125 to 180 pounds each.

i. Army honeless heef. g (1) This is carcass beef of Army specifi-
cation, class, grade, and weight, cut into wholesale market cuts in
accordance with specific instructions. The bones, excess fat, gristle,
and tendons are removed and the cuts of boneless beef separated into
groups according to their tenderness. The most tender cuts are
packed for use as roasts and steaks, while the less tender cuts are
packed for use as boiling or stewing beef, or for ground meat (ham-
burger, meat loaf, etc.). The larger cuts are individually wrapped
in waxed paper and the smaller cuts wrapped in imits of about 10
pounds. The wrapped meat is packed in fiberboard boxes coated on
the inside with paraffin. The meat may be chilled but is usually
frozen.

(2) Army boneless beef has many advantages over carcass beef.

All the meat delivered is edible and there is no waste in bones, fat,
or gristle. It requires no butchering except the further cutting for
steaks and stews. It reduces required storage space by 60 to 70
percent. It reduces weight by approximately 25 percent. It sup-
plies meat in cuts more suitable for definite purposes than would
be possible from the use of carcass beef.

(3) Frozen Army boneless beef should be thawed in the original
container, either in chill rooms or at room temperature. Seventy-

two hours or more may be required to defrost frozen boneless beef
in chill rooms, but at room temperatures the meat becomes sufficiently
defrosted for use in 24 hours. Frozen meat should not be defrosted
in water, either hot or cold. No deterioration will take place during
defrosting if tlie meat is kept wrapped and in the shipping boxes.
Beef does not have to be completely defrosted before it is used.
However, meat containing considerable frost requires a somewhat
longer time to cook. For the thawing of frozen meat in the field
see paragi’aph Zlg.

(4) Army boneless beef should not be confused with commercial
boneless beef which is made from lower grades of beef, largely from
cow and bull carcasses. Such boneless cuts are deficient in tenderness
palatability and food value, and should never be accepted for Army
boneless beef.
