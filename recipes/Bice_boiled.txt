Bice_boiled

7 pounds rice 4 ounces salt

3 gallons water

Wash the rice thoroughly in several waters. When the water
comes to a boil, sprinkle in the rice and salt. Boil in an uncovered
kettle, stirring once or twice with a fork. Boil about 30 minutes or
until the rice can be mashed in the fingers; reduce the heat and keep
on stove sufficiently long to drive off moisture. When finished each
grain will be whole and separate. If cooked too much the grains
will burst and stick together. Serve hot, as an addition to meat
dislies. If served as a vegetable, add gravy, or add raisins and serve
with milk and sugar.
