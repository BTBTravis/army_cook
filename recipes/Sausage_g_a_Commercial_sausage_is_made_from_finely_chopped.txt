c. Cooked and smoked sausages, such as bologna, frankfurters, etc.,
are made from combinations of beef and pork trimmings and meat
products.

d. Dry sausage includes all summer sausages which are made from
pork and beef trimmings and for the most part are preserved by
drying. Some varieties of summer sausage are smoked. Dry sau-
sage containing lean pork, prepared in an official establishment, is
prepared in one of the ways prescribed by the Bureau of Animal
Industry to kill any trichinae that might be in the pork. No dry
sausage should be used unless it was prepared in an official
establishment.
