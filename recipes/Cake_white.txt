Cake_white

7 pounds sugar 10 ounces baking powder

3^ pounds fat (butter, lard, or lard 2 ounces salt

substitute) 4 cans milk, evaporated, or 13 ounces

24 eggs powdered skim milk dissolved in 3

2% ounces flavoring extract pints water

13^2 pounds flour

Cream together the sugar, fat, eggs, and flavoring extract, adding
one ingredient at a time in the order given. The flour, baking
powder, and salt should be sifted together twice and added grad-
ually. Add a part of the milk from time to time as needed to
make the mixing easy. If mixed in a mechanical mixer, the beating
operation should be at second speed. When all the milk is added
there should be a stiff batter. If too stiff, more milk or water may
be added. This may be baked in round pans for layer cake or in
large pans for shortcake. If used for layer cake use two to four
layers to form a cake when cool enough to handle and spread any
desired filling between layers. Cover top and sides with same filling
or an icing. If baked in sheet form, it may be made into layer cake
or served plain or with a sweet sauce. This may also be made into
cupcakes.
