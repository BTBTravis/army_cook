no dilference between cane and beet sugar. The term “granulated”
simply means that the sugar is in crystals of a certain size. The
Army uses the size “fine granulated” or “medium fine granulated.”
Powdered sugar is beet or cane sugar, ground to a powder. The
powdered sugar for icing contains a small percentage of starch to
give the icing a smooth appearance.

h. Brown sugar has not been completely refined and contains a
small amount of molasses. Therefore its mineral content is higher i
than that of refined sugar g this gives brown sugar its distinctive
flavor. It is used where its flavor and color are desired as in some
types of cookies, cakes, and puddings. If brown sugar is kept in
a moist place or in a tight jar it will not cake, but if kept in a dry
place it will cake.
