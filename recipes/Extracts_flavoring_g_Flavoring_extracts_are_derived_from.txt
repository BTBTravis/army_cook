Extracts_flavoring_g_Flavoring_extracts_are_derived_from
two sources: plants, known as “true extracts,” and chemical com-

• pounds that produce the desired flavor and aroma for which the extract
is named. Such flavors are called “synthetic” or “imitation” flavors.
The true extracts have a more delicate flavor and aroma than the
synthetic flavors. Most Army messes use only vanilla and lemon
flavors. There are many more on the market and much interest can
be added to the food by using a variety of flavors.
