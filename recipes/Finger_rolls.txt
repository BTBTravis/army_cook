Finger_rolls

Use the basic dough. Scale into 2-ounce pieces, using the method
shown in recipe 281 but cutting from 32-ounce pieces. Roll each piece
about twice in a circular motion (do not form into a complete ball),
then with the flat hand roll out into a cylinder or “snake” about
5 inches long. Endeavor to keep the ends square. It requires some
experience to make neat finger rolls. Then place the rolls well apart
on a well-greased bakepan, allow to proof (rise) until about double
in size, and bake about 15 minutes in a medium oven (325°-400° F. g
12 to 16 counts). These rolls are used for hot dogs and are good for
lunches in the field, on the target range, etc.
