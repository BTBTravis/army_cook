Mayonnaise_dressing


2 tablespoonfuls mustard
Salt and cayenne pepper to taste


6 eggs

1 gallon salad oil
8 tablespoonfuls vinegar

First, every utensil used should be chilled or cooled. Break open
the eggs into a mixing bowl and add the cayenne pepper, salt, and
mustard. Work it in until it is thoroughly mixed. Begin dropping
in the oil, stirring constantly in the same direction, putting in only
a few drops at first. When it begins to thicken, drop in a few drops
of vinegar, then the oil again, a very little. Continue this until all of
the materials are used. Be careful not to use too much vinegar as
this makes it thin. It should be thick enough to drop when ready
for use.
