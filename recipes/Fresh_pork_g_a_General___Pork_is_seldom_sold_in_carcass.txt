form or in sides. Practically all hog carcasses are made into com-
i mercial cuts in the packing plant (see pork chart, fig. 15). The
heavy lines on the bone structure chart (fig. 16) show the division
i of the side into the major wholesale cuts. About 30 percent of the
pork carcass is sold fresh; the rest is made into cured and smoked
meats, rendered into lard, or manufactured into sausage. Demands
of the trade influence the way the side of pork will be cut and
used. Consequently, pork cuts cannot be classified definitely as those
which are always sold fresh and those which are always cured, be-

cause practically every pork cut may be cured, and under certain
conditions, is cured. On the other hand, some of the cuts which are
usually cured may be available as fresh pork.

h. Pointers about pork . g Most hogs are marketed under 1 year of
age, so the flesh is usually tender and the bones soft. In older hogs,
however, the meat will not be as tender and the bones will not be as
soft as they are in young pork. In general, the pork produced
in the United States is quite uniform, so there are fewer grades
than in other meats. The color of young pork is a grayish pink
changing to a delicate rose in the older animal. The flesh is com-
paratively firm and fine grained, and free from excessive moisture.
The lean is well marbled and covered with a firm white fat.

c. Place of pork in Army mess. g (1) There are several reasons
why pork is valuable in the Army mess. It has a high fat content
which makes it an excellent energy food. A meal containing consid-
erable fat “sticks to the ribs.” That is one reason why nothing is so
satisfying as a breakfast of ham or bacon and eggs. Pork is an out-
standing source of thiamine (vitamin Bj). This vitamin is needed
for growth; it aids in the utilization of carbohydrates; it promotes
the health of the body cells; and it prevents the disease, beriberi.
Pork is a universally liked meat. The per capita consumption of
pork and beef in the United States has been approximately the same
for many years. Pork is also valuable in the Army mess from the
standpoints of variety and economy. Sometimes the statement is
made that pork is “hard to digest,” but this is not true. Being some-
what fatter than other meats it may remain in the stomach for a
longer period; biit it digests in the same length of time as chicken,
and in common with other meats, it is completely utilized by the body.

(2) Pork should always be cooked thoroughly for the following
reasons :

(ff) Pork muscle (lean meat) may contain trichinae. These micro-
scopic parasites cause trichinosis in human beings. Fortunately the
trichina parasite is killed by thorough cooking. Well-done pork is
])erfoctly safe to eat.

{h) The rich, delicious flavor of pork is developed more fully
when it is cooked slowly and thoroughly.
