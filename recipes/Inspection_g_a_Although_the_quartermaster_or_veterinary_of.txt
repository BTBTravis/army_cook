Inspection_g_a_Although_the_quartermaster_or_veterinary_of
ficer inspects all foods when received, this does not relieve mess
personnel from the responsibility of inspection when received in the
mess. In the absence of the mess sergeant, it becomes the duty of
the cook on shift to receive, inspect, sign for, and properly store all
food items received, unless other definite arrangement has been made
by the organization commander.
