Basic_dough


10 pounds flour 13 ounces sugar

(iy 2 ounces yeast, compressed 13 ounces fat (lard or lard substitute)

&lt;5 pints water or milk 2% ounces salt

Dissolve the yeast in 2 pints of the water at a temperature of 80°
F. Dissolve the sugar and salt in remainder of water. Add this to
the flour and mix slightly. Add the dissolved yeast and the fat and
mix thoroughly. Regulate the quantity of liquid to make a soft
dough. Set to rise in a well-greased pan covered with a slightly
damp cloth. In cold weather, or if the kitchen is cold, it is well to
keep this cloth dampened with warm (not hot) water. If the tem-
perature of the room is about 80°, it is sufficient to allow the dough
to rise. Ferment and punch as for basic sweet dough. It is best to
work up this dough while it is still on the young side. Do not allow
it to overferment.

This dough makes rolls, etc., which are preferred by many to those
made from the basic sweet dough. It may be made into a variety
of rolls, as parkerhouse, sandwich buns, finger rolls, pan rolls, etc., or
may be used to make a raisin bread. It may also be used to make
plain bread which is superior for toast.
