4 pounds bacon, sliced prepared

1 pint molasses 2 pounds onions, chopped

1 pint catsup 2 pounds tomatoes, fresh, or one can to-

Wash and soak the beans for 4 hours or overnight in cold water.
Drain, place in hot water, and simmer for 2 hours. Drain and place
beans in bakepan or covered earthen crocks. Mix in the chopped
onions and tomatoes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place
sliced bacon on top of the beans. Make a mixture of the molasses,
catsup, and mustard, adding a little vinegar if dry mustard is used,
and pour over the beans. Cover the pan and bake in a slow oven
(below 200Â° F. g 24 counts) for 4 hours, or until tender. Serve hot.

In cold weather the soaking may be overnight, in which case the
2-hour simmering will not be necessary. In hot weather the beans
may sour if soaked when a cool temperature cannot be obtained.
When this condition is met with, beans may be baked as follows :

Wash the beans in cold water, drain, and place in cold water; sim-
mer 45 minutes, drain, and put beans in bakepan. Mix in chopped
onion and tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Place sliced
bacon on top of the beans. Make a mixture of molasses, catsup, and
mustard, and pour over the beans. Cover the pan and bake in a
slow oven for 5 hours, or until tender. Serve hot.
