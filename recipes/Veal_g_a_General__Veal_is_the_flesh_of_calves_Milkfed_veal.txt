is considered best. According to Federal specifications, the minimum
weight of dressed veal for the Army is 75 pounds, maximum weight
190 pounds. The moisture content of veal is high and its protective
covering of fat is quite thin. Therefore, hanging or aging is not
advisable. It must be ordered fresh and used promptly.

h. How to judge quality of veal . g The shape or general build of
the carcass is the first thing to consider in judging quality of veal.
The same thing is true of other kinds of meat. Good quality veal
is plump and blocky; the neck and shanks are short; the rounds are
full; the shoulders thick; and the rib and loin well fleshed. The
carcass is thinly covered with clear, firm, white fat and the flesh
is firm and light grayish in color. The kidneys should be covered
with firm fat.

c. Place of veal in Army menu. g Two factors recommend veal as
an article of diet in the Army menu. These are: tenderness and
variety. Veal is a wholesome, nutritious meat, and being from a
young animal it is always tender. The delicate flavor of veal is
relished by many.
