2% pounds fat (butter, lard, or lard
substitute)

4 iK)unds fruit, dried, stewed, ground
10 quarts milk, fresh, or 10 cans milk,
evaporated, diluted with 10 pints
water.

Cream the fat and sugar and flavoring extract. Sift together the
flour, baking powder, and cinnamon three times and add this and the
fruit to the creamed mixture with the milk. Water may be used in
place of the milk, but does not make as good a cake. Stir well and
bake about 40 minutes in a moderate oven (250°-32.5° F. g 16 to 18
counts) . Serve plain or iced. This recipe produces a fairly palatable
cake which can be made from items included in the field ration, or
when eggs are not available.
