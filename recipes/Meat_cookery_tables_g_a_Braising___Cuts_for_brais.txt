(2) How to hrcdse. g {a) Season with salt and pepper. Herbs,
spicses, and vegetables may be added for flavor variety.

(6) Brown meat on all sides in hot fat. Browning develops aroma,
flavor, and color.

(&lt;?) Add a very small amotmt of liquid, if necessary. Both meat
and gravy will 1^ more attractive. No liquid should be added to
pork chops.

(d) Cook at a simmering temperature (186°-200° F.). Meat
should never be boiled. High temperature dissolves connective tis-
sue, making meat stringy and hard to carve. It also increases
shrinkage and dries out meat. Braising may be done in oven or
on top of range.

h. Frying and deep-fat frying. g (1) Frying.  ^Frying means to
cook in a shallow layer of fat. It differs from pan-broiling in which
no fat is added, and is used for thin slices of round steak, veal steak
and chops, liver, and sometimes pork chops. Frying gives crispy
browned exterior and fine-flavored but less tender product than
braising.

(2) Method for frying'. g ^Dredge meat in flour, if desired. Season
with salt and pepper. Brown quickly on both sides in a small
amount of hot fat. Do not cover. Continue to cook at reduced
temperature until done.

(3) Deep- fat frying. g Deep-fat frying means to cook in a deep
layer of fat. It is not recommended for uncooked meat. It may
be a convenient method for browning breaded chops which have
been partially or wholly cooked before crumbing, and is often used
to finish cooking precooked chicken. It is used in preparation of
croquettes. Care should be taken to keep fat from smoking.

(4) Temperatures for deep-fat frying.

(2) How to pcm hroiJ. g {a) Place meat on heavj’ frying pan or
griddle. Pan need not be preheated.

(&amp;) Do not add fat. Enough fat cooks out to grease pan.

{c) Brown well on both sides. This develops flavor and aroma.
{d) Season with salt and pepper.

{e) Beduce temperature; meat will be juicier. Prevents over-
browning.

(/) Do not cover or add water. The meat will braise, not broil, in
the presence of moisture. The aim in pan broiling is to get results
comparable to broiling.

{g) Turn occasionally. This insures even cooking.

(A) Pour off fat which collects in pan. Meat should broil, not fry.

(3) Cooking time. g {a) Definite times for pan broiling cannot be
given. The time is about the same as for broiling a cut of same
thickness.

(&amp;) To test for sufficient cooking cut small gash and note color.

(c) Beef steaks may be cooked rare to medium. Ground meat
should be cooked well done.

(4) Suggestions. g (a) Use tender cuts.

{h) Steaks or chops should not be cut too thick.

{c) When pan broiling ground meat, rub pan with a little fat.

(ft) Season with salt and pepper. Seasoning may be added at
start, during, or end of cooking.

(c) Place fat side up. Basting is not necessary g as fat melts it
runs over and through meat.

{d) Do not cover. Steam surrounds meat which is covered, mak-
ing it a pot roast.

{e) Roast at a constant, moderate temperature (325® F. g 16
counts). Searing does not keep in juices. Meat and gravy will be
nicely browned without initial sear. A moderate temperature reduces
shrinkage and increases flavor, juiciness, and tenderness.

(/) Do not add water. With a moderate temperature, drippings
will not burn.

{g) Roast until done. Time depends on kind of meat, degree of
doneness, and oven temperature. A meat thermometer is the most
accurate way to tell when roast is done.

(2) Iloxc to make stew. g («) Have meat cut in small cubes. A
j boneless stew is more attractive than one with bones. Avoid bone
' splinters by avoiding use of cleaver, if stew meat is not boneless.

(ft) Season with salt and pepper. The salt will penetrate small
]&gt;ieces, so is best put in at start of cooking.

(c) If desired, brown on all .sides in hot fat. A browned stew has
more meat flavor than a light stew.

{d) Cover with water. The water need not be boiling as hot water
! does not seal in juices any more than searing. ISIeat should be
^ covered by water so that all will be cooked at same temperature,
i (e) Cover kettle.

(/) Cook at a simmering temperature (18.5°-200° F.) until tender
(about 2 to 21/^ hours). Meat will be stringy and tasteless if boiled.

(r/) Add vegetables just long enough before meat is tender so that
they Avill be done, but not overcooked. Vegetables should be uniform
in size.

i (3) For vcuriefy in stews. g (a) Use diiferent combinations of
i vegetables.

I (ft) Strive for attractive color combinations,

i (c) Tomatoes will give flavor variety to the gravy.

! (d) Omit potatoes and serve rice or boiled noodles in their place.

(e) Turnips give a sweet taste to a stew which many do not relish.

I (/) Avoid the use of parsnips or other vegetables which many do
I not like.

{e) Veal . g Veal is not cooked in water.

(/) Lamh . g Lamb is not cooked in water.

(2) How to cook in water. g (a) Cover meat with water. The
water need not be hot since boiling water does not seal in juices.
The meat should be entirely covered so that all of meat will cook at
same temperature.

(6) Season with salt and pepper, except smoked pork cuts and
corned beef. Cloves, peppercorns, bayleaf, or flavor vegetables may
be added.

(&lt;?) Cover and cook at simmering temperature until meat is tender.
Never boil because the connective tissue will be dissolved and the
meat hard to carve; also, shrinkage will be greater and meat will
be dry and tasteless.

{d) If vegetables, such as potatoes, onions, or cabbage, are cooked
in kettle with meat they should be put in just long enough before
meat is done for them to be tender. Overcooking vegetables gives
them a poor texture and strong flavor.

(3) Timetable for cooking in water.
