THE ARMY COOK


For serving as an additional vegetable use one-half of this recipe.

Open the cans and empty into bakepans or, if they cannot be
heated in the oven, place in boilers. They may be served after simply
heating (requiring about 15 minutes) but will be improved by adding
2 bottles or one-half of a No. 10 can of catsup, also about 12 whole
onions, % gallon of pickles, 2 or 3 pounds of sliced or cut bacon,
2 quarts of molasses, and 8 ounces of prepared (wet) mustard.
The quantities of these additional ingredients may be varied accord-
ing to what is on hand. The bacon should be laid on top of the
beans, but onions, pickles, molasses, and mustard should be mixed
through them. If bacon and onions are added, it is necessary to
bake or cook the beans at least 30 minutes. If this is done the
temperature should be kept below the boiling point if in a boiler,
and if in an oven at slow heat (200°-250® F. g 18 to 20 counts).

Note. g In the absence of any other means of cookinsr, canned beans (as
well as any other canned food) may be heated for serving by immersing the
cans for about 15 minutes in hot or boiling water. The heat causes an internal
expansion which may cause the hot contents to spurt out when the can is
opened after removing, from the hot water, and the cook who opens the cans
must use care to avoid being scalded. If it is desired to prevent contamina-
tion of the water in which the unopened cans are heated, the labels should be
removed and the cans washed clean before immersing.
