Use the basic dough and make up into loaves. If no individual
bread pans are on hand, scale into 35-ounce pieces, round, and let
rest until loose (about 20 minutes). Form into loaves and place six
of these in one black iron bakepan. Proof (rise) until just above
edge of pan and bake about 30 minutes in a medium oven (325°-400°
F. g 12 to 16 counts).
