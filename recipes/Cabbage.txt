Cabbage

When preparing cabbage, take off dead and dry outer leaves. Slice
about Y 2 inch off the stalk of each head and place the head in cool
fresh water, being sure that stem end is immersed in the water for
several hours. The cabbage will take up water through the stem
as a flower would, and become cool and crisp. Cabbage should never
be overcooked until it assumes a tan color. Cooked cabbage should
always retain the natural green color. It should be cooked only long
enough to make it tender. This requires only about 20 minutes for
boiled cabbage. Always boil in an open kettle, as this allows strong
odors to escape.
