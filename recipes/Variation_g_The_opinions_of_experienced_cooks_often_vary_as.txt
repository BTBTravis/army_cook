Variation_g_The_opinions_of_experienced_cooks_often_vary_as
to the exact quantities of food required to prepare various dishes
for a given number of men. This variation of opinions is due to
individual taste or based upon their knowledge of the preference
of their particular messes. The recipes in this manual are designed
to be a guide for those who do not definitely know the exact quanti-
ties required, and these recipes will produce satisfactory results if
accurately followed. The quantities shown for 100 men may be
successfully modified by an experienced cook and should be so modi-
fied by experience where local conditions justify or demand this. The
quantity of food consumed by a mess will vary according to the char-
acter of duty performed, the number of absentees, the season of the
year, and many other causes, and the same mess will require notice-
ably varying quantities, dependent upon varying conditions of serv-
ice. Inexperienced cooks should follow the recipes contained herein ;
experienced cooks may successfully deviate from the recipes under
certain conditions, and all cooks should know by experience the proper
quantities of food required to satisfy their own messes. This knowl-
edge is acquired by the constant study of these and other recipes
and of the preference of the messes which they serve, as evidenced
by their consumption or rejection of the dishes offered.
