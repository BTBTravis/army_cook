17 quarts cranberries 6 pounds sugar

Wash and stem the berries, put in a boiler, and cover with about 1
inch of cold water. Cover tightly and boil until berries break to
pieces and cover themselves with their juice. Eemove the lid and
simmer for 30 minutes. If a sauce free of skins is desired, rub through
a colander. Then pour into an earthen or wooden vessel and cool.
Serve cold with chicken, turkey, or other kinds of meat.
