venience. during warm weather and an improvised one may be con-
structed by simply setting a drygoods box inside of a larger one,
preparing the necessary lids, and filling the space between the two
boxes (4 to 8 inches) with sawdust, gunny sacks, leaves, grass, hay,
straw, or any available nonconducting material. Or even better,
use a single box set in the ground and packed around with materials
as noted above or with solid dirt.

h. To provide a simple ice box for the field, sink a packing box of
suitable size into the ground and prepare a close-fitting cover in
two parts, for convenience in handling. It is well to surround the
box with heavy paper or with packed straw or grass to prevent dirt
from falling in through the cracks. To provide drainage, bore
several holes in the bottom of the box, and if practicable, put a
quantity of stone or gravel in the bottom of the pit before installing
the box. If facilities are at hand, provide a double box (fig. 42) . It
will be cleaner and on account of the double top the ice will last
longer.
