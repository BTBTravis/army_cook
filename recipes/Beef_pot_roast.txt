55 pounds beef, fresh Salt and pepper to taste

2 pounds onions 3 pounds flour

Use meat from the chuck, brisket, shoulder, or any other less tender
part of the carcass and cut into 5-pound pieces. Make a gravy of
beef stock and flour batter. Season well with salt and pepper. Put
the meat and onions in the gravy and cook in a slow oven (200°-250°
F. g 18 to 20 counts) until tender. The gravy should cover the meat
in the pan about one-half inch as in the preparation of beef a la mode.
Slice the meat and serve on a platter with hot gravy poured over it.
Serve with dumplings.
