oil? yolk, lemon juice or vinegar, and seasoning (salt, pepper,
etc.). Mayonnaise may be made in the kitchen at a considerable
saving. A variety of dressings can be made using mayonnaise as a
base. Russian dressing can be made by adding lemon juice, chili
sauce, and Worcestershire sauce to taste. Tartare sauce can be made
by adding chopped green olives and pickles to mayonnaise.

h. Salad dressing might be thought of as a diluted mayonnaise. It
is made of oil, egg yolk, lemon juice or vinegar, and cornstarch
as a filler. A good salad dressing should contain at least 35 percent
oil. However, many brands are on the market with as low as 9
percent oil. For this reason there is a great variation in price. The
same variety of dressings may be made as with mayonnaise using salad
dressing as a base.

c. French dressing is a mixture of oil, lemon juice or vinegar, salt,
mustard, and other spices, if desired. The oil will separate from
the liquid and spices and care should be taken to see that the ingredi-
ents are well mixed before using. French dressings are now on the
market containing a carrier that prevents separation.

d. The common salad oils used are refined cottonseed and corn oil.
Olive oil is also used but is usually too expensive for use in the mess.
Soya bean oil is used to some extent but does not have the keeping
qualities of the other oils. Any of these oils may be used for making
the various dressings in the troop mess.
