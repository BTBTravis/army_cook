Strip off the outer leaves, remove the cores, wash, quarter, and
soak. Place in a boiler with sufficient water to cover. Add the meat,
and season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook in an open boiler for
20 minutes, adding boiling water as required to keep the cabbage
completely covered at all times. Serve hot.
