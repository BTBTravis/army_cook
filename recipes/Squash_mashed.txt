25 pounds squash, fresh 2 pounds bacon drippings

4 quarts beef stock

Peel the squash, remove the seeds, and clean well. Cut in pieces
not more than 2 inches square, place in a boiler, and pour the beef
stock over it. Season to taste with salt and pepper, close the boiler
with a tight lid, and boil about 2 hours (or until well done). Add
the bacon drippings and mash well before serving. Serve hot.
