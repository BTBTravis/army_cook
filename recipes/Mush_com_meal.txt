10 pounds corn meal, white or yellow 7 gallons water

3 pounds sugar li/^ ounces salt

Bring the salted water to a hoil, then add the sugar and corn meal,
meanwhile whipping briskly to prevent lumping. Cook for about
20 minutes and then allow to stand about the same length of time
where it will remain hot. Place in vegetable dishes and serve with
fresh milk or diluted evaporated milk.
