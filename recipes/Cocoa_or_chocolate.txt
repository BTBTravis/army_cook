Cocoa_or_chocolate


3 iKtunds cocoa, or 2% pounds choc- 5 pounds sugar
olate, plain 32 cans milk, evaporated

Put 8 gallons of water into an urn or boiler and bring to a boil.
Take out 1 gallon of the hot water and dissolve the cocoa and sugar
in this. If chocolate is used, first melt it in a double boiler. Then
add to the remainder of the hot water and cook 5 minutes. Reduce
the heat and add the milk, and stir well. Water may be used in
place of milk, but this reduces the palatability.

In hot weather, iced cocoa is popular.
