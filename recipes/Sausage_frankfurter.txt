35 pounds frankfurter sausage

Place sausage in boiling water, but do not allow it to boil thereafter,
as this causes the skins to crack, rendering them unsightly and injur-
ing the flavor. Long cooking also injures the quality ; therefore, the
sausage should not be put into the water more than 15 minutes before
serving. Serve hot.
