Strip off outer leaves and remove the cores; cut into fine shreds,
wash and soak, and place in a boiler containing the pork or bacon,
vinegar, and 2 gallons of water. Season with salt and pepper. Boil
rapidly in an open boiler for about 20 minutes, adding boiling water,
if necessary, to keep covered. Then thicken slightly with a flour
batter and boil for about 5 minutes longer. Serve hot.
