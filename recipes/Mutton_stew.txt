THE ARMY COOK


Cut the mutton into 1-inch cubes. Add sufficient beef stock or cold
water to just cover the mutton, and allow to simmer slowly for \y^
hours or until the mutton is done. Add vegetables and cook until
done. Season to taste with pepper and salt and thicken slightly with
a flour batter. Serve hot with or without dumplings (recipe 80). If
dumplings are added, use only 20 pounds of mutton and 30 pounds of
potatoes.
