corn with the hull removed and the fine corn flour sifted out. About
the only difference between hominy grits and corn meal is that the
com meal is of a finer grind. Both can be cooked and served as a

muflins and corn bread. The grits are often used as a substitute for
potatoes and served with gravy.
