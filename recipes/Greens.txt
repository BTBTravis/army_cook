Greens

30 pounds greens 4 pounds bacon

1 quart beef stock

Wash in cold water, changing water at least four times to remove
grit. Put the greens and bacon in 4 gallons of cold water and boil in
an open boiler until tender (about 10 minutes). Serve hot, season
to taste with salt, pepper, and vinegar or add the following prepa-
ration : Remove the bacon and strain the free water from the greens,
chop greens fine and place in a well-greased bakepan, add beef stock
to moisten, and bake in an oven for about hour. Season with salt
and pepper to taste. Slice the bacon and serve on top of the greens.
Greens may be improved in appearance and taste by the addition of
minced hard-boiled eggs in the serving dish. Excessive cooking will
destroy their vitamin properties.

Beet tops, dandelion, spinach, turnip tops, and other greens may be
jjrepared in the same way.
