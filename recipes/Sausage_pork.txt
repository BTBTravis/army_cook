Sausage_pork

(32 lb. mixture)


20 pounds pork, lean
12 pounds beef, lean
4 ounces salt
3 ounces i&gt;epper, black


% ounce coriander
% ounce sage
% pint vinegar
1 clove garlic


Dice the pork in 1^-inch squares. Grind the beef and mix with the
pork, add all the seasoning and mix well, then grind again. The
more thoroughly the sausage is mixed, the better it will be. Mold
into patties each about 4 ounces and fry without the addition of fat.
Serve hot. If too dry, add water. If desired, 10 pounds of dry
bread or cracker crumbs or corn meal may be ground in, but this does
not improve the product.
