Bacon_fried

22 pounds bacon, issue, or 24 pounds bacon, breakfast

Cut about five slices to the inch. If dry salt issue bacon is used,
place in a bakepan containing boiling water, boil for 5 minutes, then
drain off water. Fry on a hot range or in a quick oven. Drain off
excess fat and stir occasionally so that all the bacon is thoroughly
cooked. If served with eggs or hot cakes, etc., 10 pounds bacon are
sufficient.
