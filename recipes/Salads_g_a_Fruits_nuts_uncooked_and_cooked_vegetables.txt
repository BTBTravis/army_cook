cooked meats, fish and fowl, served cold and dressed with condiments,
oils, and acids, are known as salads.

h. The following fundamentals must be observed in the preparation
of salads :

(1) ~W ashing ingredients. g ^Wash salad greens and examine to in-
sure the removal of all insects. Then soak in cold water to crisp, and
dry by shaking in a wire basket.

(2) Chilling. g ^All ingredients, fruits, vegetables, and dressing
should be chilled before mixing.

(3) Cutting up materials. g Salad materials should be cut in uni-
form pieces small enough so that they will not lose their shape when
mixed. When meat is used it should be diced and not ground.

(4) Mixing. g When mixing the materials they should be lightly
tossed with two forks or the hands. The salad dressing should never
be added to the salad until time for serving, except in the case of
potato salad, when it is preferable for the dressing to soak in. The
dressing should be folded in. Excess dressing should be avoided ; only
sufficient added to coat the separate pieces of material. Free dressing
in the bottom of the dish is an indication that too much dressing was
added.

(5) Garnishing. g The salad should be attractively served. If indi-
vidual salads are served, the plate should be garnished with lettuce,
parsley, green pepper, or similar small greens. Other garnishes that
may be used are strips of pimento, dash of paprika, shredded carrots,
whole radishes, cherries, or grapes.
