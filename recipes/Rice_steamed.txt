Rice_steamed

7 pounds rice 4 ounces salt

2 gallons water

Wash the rice thoroughly in several waters. Bring the water to a
boil, add the salt, sprinkle in the rice, and let boil for 5 minutes,
then let cook at a simmering temperature for 45 minutes with the
lid partly open so that the steam may escape. When stirring rice,
always use a fork to avoid breaking the kernels.
