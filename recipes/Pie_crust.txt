Pie_crust

(Makes 3 double 9-inch crusts)

1 pound flour % ounce salt

8 ounces fat (lard or lard substitute) % pint cold water

All ingredients should be thoroughly chilled before using.

Mix the flour with one-half the fat by chopping or cutting with
a food chopper or knife until the size of corn meal. Then mix in
the remainder of the fat by the same method, except that the fat
is cut in so as to leave the mixture in small pieces, about the size
of a bean, then add the cold water slowly while tossing the mixture
with a fork. A medium-soft dough, not slack or stiff, is easiest to
handle. Roll and handle as little as possible.

Best results will be had by making up pie crust dough in small
batches like this recipe for three pies.
