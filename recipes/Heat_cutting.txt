e. (Added.) Care of meat hlocka . g (1) Clean cutting block or table
after each use. The block will be much easier to keep clean if blood and
moisture from meat are not given a chance to soak deeply into the wood.

(2) Use steel scraper and wire brush to clean block. These two
accessories are necessary to keep cutting surface of block clean and
sanitary.

(3) Scrape and brush block thoroughly at end of day’s work,
This will remove most of the moisture and allow the block to dry
out overnight. It assures an odorless, clean surface for cutting.

(4) Keep cutting head of block dry. Moisture from fresh meat,
brine, and blood soak into the wood, causing the block to expand and
the wood to soften. This also affects the strength of glued joints.
Therefore ;

(а) Do not wash cutting surface of block.

{h) Do not wash meat tools on top of block.

(c) Do not allow fresh moist meat to lie on block longer tiian
necessary.

(5) Maintain same bevel on edges of block that it had when new.
This will prevent splitting and chipping of outside boards.

(6) Turn block weekly. Every part of cutting surface will then

wear down evenly. .
