Wholesale_market_cuts_of_beef_for_small_messes_g_In
small messes where it is impractical to use beef in quarters, wholesale
market beef cuts are available. These should be of the same class
and grade required for carcass beef. Beef piirchased as wholesale
market cuts usually costs the organization more than when quarters
are purchased. However, certain cuts can be readily obtained that
will meet all the requirements of the mess at no increased cost. The
square-cut chuck weighs just a little more than half the weight of
the forequarter. The round weighs just a little less than half the
weight of the hindquarter. The square-cut chuck sells at an average
of 15 to 20 percent less than carcasses, and the round sells at an
average of 15 to 20 percent more than carcass price. These two cuts
when bought alternately will cost just about the same as carcass
beef, and will yield beef suitable for every purpose for which the
whole carcass could be used. They have the advantage over carcass
beef in having less waste because carcasses contain the skirt, flank,
kidney knob, etc., which have waste and are not easy to use to
advantage. Wholesale market cuts should be used in the same way
as described for those cuts under carcass beef.
