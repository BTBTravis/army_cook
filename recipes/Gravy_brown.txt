The gravy should be made in the pan used in roasting the meat, as
only by this method can all the extractives lost from the meat be
retained in the gravy. Brown gravy is made from the drippings
of roasted meat or fowl and the frying of pork. One quart of fat
will make 2 gallons of gravy. Take the fat in the roasting pan after
the meat or fowl has been removed, heat to the smoking point, and
add enough flour to absorb the hot fat, stirring constantly to prevent
burning and lumping. When the flour is brown, add cold water
(about 1 gallon to the pound of flour used) and continue cooking and
stirring until the gravy is smooth and of the desired thickness or con-
sistency. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot. Brown gravy may
also be made from stock by the same procedure, except that 2 quarts
of stock are used instead of 1 quart of drippings; however, gravy
made from stock is not nearly as palatable as that made from roast
drippings.
