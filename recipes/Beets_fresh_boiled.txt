Beets_fresh_boiled

26 pounds beets

Clean the beets thoroughly but do not skin or cut off roots. Boil
until well done, then hold under a faucet of cold water and rub the
skins off with the hands and remove roots. Cut into slices or, if
young and tender, serve whole. Serve hot .with butter, cream sauce,
or gravy. While washing and cooking be careful not to break the
skins as to do so would cause bleeding.
