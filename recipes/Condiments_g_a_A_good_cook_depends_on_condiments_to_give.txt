plants used to season food. They may be used in ground form and
mixed with the food or they may be used whole and withdrawn
before servipg the food. Whole spices are usually used in the prep-
aration of soups, sauces, and pot roasts.

Vegetables should be cooked in salted water. The cook must be care-

Salt can be added to the food after it is prepared, but once added,
it cannot be removed.
