6 ounces cinnamon

Roll the basic dough into sheets about ^ inch thick, 15 inches wide,
and convenient lengths. Brush with melted fat and sprinkle liberally
with sugar and cinnamon. Roll the sheet dough into a tight roll as a
cigarette and cut into ^-inch thick slices with a sharp knife. Place
close together in well-greased pans with cut sides, which have first
been sprinkled with sugar, up and down. Let rise until double in size
and bake in a medium oven (325°g 400° F.  12 to 16 counts) 30 to 40

in the oven to insure being well baked on bottom. Turn out of pans
to prevent sticking. When cool, cover with uncooked icing if desired.
