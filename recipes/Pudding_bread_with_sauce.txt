4 pounds fruit, fresh, dried, or canned 4 cans milk, evaptuated, or 4 quarts
4 pounds sugar milk, fresh, or 1 pound powdered

Soak the bread in the milk. Season with sugar and cinnamon,
add raisins and beaten eggs, mix, and spread about 1 inch deep in
pan. Over this spread about 1 inch of fruit stewed (if dried) then
another layer of the bread mixture. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon
over the top layer. Bake about 40 minutes in a medium oven (325°-

sauce. This makes an excellent dish and gives an opportunity to use
available scrap bread. Shredded coconut may be used to improve
the flavor.
