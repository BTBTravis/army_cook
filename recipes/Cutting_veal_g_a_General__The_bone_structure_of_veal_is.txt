identical with that of beef. (Compare the veal bone structure chart
(fig. 18) with the beef bone structure chart (fig. 3).) The names of
the wholesale market cuts and the way they are made in the packing-
house are very similar to lamb. Figure 17 shows the location of
the major cuts in a side of veal. Normally, the carcass is not split
but is sold as legs, loin, rib, and triangle, or a combination of these
cuts such as the saddle and rack.

h. Veal for Army use. g As a general rule, the entire veal carcass
may be utilized in much the same way as lamb ; namely, the triangle
for stew and the long saddle for roasts. The back section (shoulders,
rack, loin, and legs) also may be cut into chops and steaks. The actual
making of boneless veal cuts for Army use, however, will involve a
combination of beef, lamb, and pork cutting methods. The reason for
this is obvious when it is realized that a light veal weighs slightly
more than a heavy lamb. A heavy veal weighs about the same as a
medium-weight dressed hog and a little under one-half the weight of

a light carcass of beef. From this it can be seen that the weight of the
veal carcass will influence materially the cutting method to be followed.

&lt;?. Light veal. g ^Light veal carcasses weighing less than 100 pounds
may be cut into boneless roasts and boneless stew in practically the
same manner as recommended for lamb (par. 23). The roasts will be
somewhat larger in circumference than the comparable lamb roasts, but
they will not be too large to cook satisfactorily.

d. Heaney veal. g A heavy veal carcass, or heavy saddles and racks,
should be split down the center of the backbone, the same as beef.
The usual procedure is to saw through the tail bone and sacral verte-
brae, then use a cleaver to finish splitting the backbone. The fore-
quarter is usually separated from the hindquarter between the twelfth
and thirteenth ribs. There is no reason, however, why all 13 ribs should
not be left on the forequarter.

(1) Forequarters. g The method described for cutting the fore-
quarter of beef (par. 20c?) will be the most satisfactory method to
follow in boning heavy veal forequarters. This method will supply
the greatest number of solid pieces of meat for roasts, if a maximum
amount of roasting meat is desired. At the same time it is an easy way
to bone tlie forequarter when only meat for stewing is needed.

(2) Hindquarters. g The heavy veal hindquarter should be divided
into four major cuts: flank, market round (round with rump off but
T\’ith knuckle attached), hip (loin end and rump), and short loin.

The tenderloin should be removed before the hip and short loin are
separated.

(a) The flank will be used for stew, or for a dish other than a roast.

(&amp;) If the market round is a large one it should be divided into four
pieces (knuckle, inside, outside, and heel) as recommended for beef
( fig. 10) . If the round is of medium size it may be split into two bone-
less rolls as recommended for a heavy fresh ham (par. 25A;).

(c) The hip (rump and loin end) should be boned in one piece. The
i-esulting boneless veal butt will make an excellent roast.

(d) The loin strip should be removed from the backbone of the shell j

loin. (A short loin with the tenderloin out is a “shell” loin.) Some- *

times it is advisable to tie two loin strips together for roasting so that '

less meat will be exposed to the oven heat. This plan is comparable to |

the way a boneless pork loin is prepared for roasting ( par. 25g ) . The
same suggestion applies to the tenderloin.
