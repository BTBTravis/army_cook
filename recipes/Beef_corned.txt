Beef_corned

60 pounds corned beef

Wash the meat in warm water and, if it has been in brine until
too salty, cover it with cold water and bring slowly to a boil. Drain
off the water, cover again with fresh cold water, and reheat. As soon
as the liquid bubbles, reduce the heat, add a few whole peppers, and
continue cooking slowly (always below the boiling point) for 2 or
3 hours, according to quality and quantity of beef, until the meat is
tender. Keep the meat closely covered during the cooking process,
and turn it when partly done, adding hot water from time to time
so as to keep it completely covered. Carrots, parsnips, and potatoes
may be added during the cooking process, if desired.
