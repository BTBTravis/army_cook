a man may be. Everyone needs to obtain from his daily diet the same
five essentials: energy, protein, minerals, vitamins, and water. A.
diet which lacks any one of these essentials is not balanced. It is only

of preparing them. He wants foods that appeal to his eyes and his
sense of taste and smell; he wants to eat in pleasant surroundings.
His food should be wholesome and good to eat.
