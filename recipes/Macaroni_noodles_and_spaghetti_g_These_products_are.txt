known as alimentary pastes. The different forms and sizes of these
pastes, are merely a matter of different molds in the machinery and
cutting to desired size. Noodles are made from the same kind of
paste as macaroni and spaghetti except that eggs are sometimes
included and are thus known as egg noodles.
