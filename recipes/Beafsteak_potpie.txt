35 i&gt;oonds beefsteak, fresh or cooked, 4 pounds onions, chopped and browned
cut in small portions 1 clove garlic

3 gallons beef stock

If fresh steak is used, season the meat with pepper and salt, roll the
small pieces of steak in flour, and fry in fat. Remove the cooked
steak, add 1 pound of flour to the frying fat, and brown. Add slowly
the 3 gallons of stock to make a thin gravy, then add the onions.
Pour this onion gravy over the steak.

If cooked steak is used, the onion gravy is made by adding 2 pounds
flour to 2 pounds hot fat, then adding the onions.

Make a regular biscuit dough, using about 10 pounds of flour. Cut
into biscuits, place them over the top of the steak and gravy, and
allow them to brown in the oven. Serve hot.
