Beef_loaf


40 pounds beef, fresh
5 pounds bacon
2 pounds onions
1 clove garlic


25 eggs, beaten

1 pound flour

2 or 3 quarts beef stock
Salt and pepper to taste


Grind the meat, onions, and garlic together. Add beaten eggs, salt,
and pepper. Mix well. Make into loaves about 4 inches wide by 3
inches high and as long as the pan is wide. A loaf of this shape can
be cut into pieces of attractive size and about the proper size for the
individual, and the pieces will hold their shape. Then make a batter
of flour and beef stock, rubbing this over the loaves. Place in the
oven (200°-250® F. g 18 to 20 counts) and make for about 1^^ hours.
