70 pork hocks, fresh 2 quarts tomato catsup

4 cans tomatoes (No. 3 cans) 3 ounces pickling spices

Simmer hocks for 30 minutes, then pour off the water and add the
tomatoes, catsup, and spices, salt, pepper. Bake until the meat is
done. Pour the cooking mixture as a sauce over the hocks when
served. Either strain the sauce to take out the pickling spices or cook
spices in a small bag so that they may be removed before serving.
Serve hot.
