Beef_braised_pot_roast


55 pounds beef, fresh (from less 1 pint vinegar

tender cut) Salt and pepper to taste

8 pounds onions, chopped

Cut the beef into pieces weighing about 5 pounds each. Wipe with
a damp cloth. Sear until well browned on all sides. Season. Place
in a large dutch oven or camp kettle or any covei’ed utensil. A heavy
utensil is best. Add the chopped onions and vinegar. If the meat
is well covered with fat, basting is not necessary. If the beef is lack-
ing in fat, it is a good practice to lard with strips of fat or place a
layer of fat on top. About 2 pounds of fat pork or bacon are required
for this. This added fat improves the flavor, melts, and bastes the
meat. Cook covered, in a slow oven (200°-250° F.) or on top of stove
until tender. This will require 2 to 5 hours, dej^jending on tenderness
of beef used. The beef should be turned three or four times while
cooking. When done, remove from utensil and slice. The pot roast
may be served in either of two ways: Make a thick gravy in the

utensil in which the beef was roasted and pour this gravy over the
sliced beef on platters, or make a gravy of the desired thickness and
serve separately,
