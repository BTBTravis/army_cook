above, it requires time for heat to penetrate to the center of food.
Therefore, a thick article of food, as a roast of beef, requires longer
than a thin article as a pork chop. If a roasting pan is filled with
pieces of beef, some weighing 2 pounds and others weighing 8 pounds,
the smaller pieces will be cooked first. Unless these smaller pieces
are removed from the oven they will become overcooked before the
larger pieces are cooked. Therefore, an effort should be made to cut
the pieces in uniform size. This also applies to potatoes and many
other foods.
