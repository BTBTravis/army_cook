important to liave a place for each utensil and keep it there, clean
and ready for use. Articles to be used, including the kitchen utensils
and the food being prepared, should be assembled within easy reach
of the cook’s table or range, in order to save time and steps. For
example, when preparing cake batter, many steps and much incon-
venience will be saved if the articles required are placed conveniently
at hand upon the table on which the work is to be done. Also, the
fire in the range should be regulated prior to beginning the mixing.
After getting one’s hand into the batter there is no time to collect
articles and regulate the fire, not to mention the inconvenience and
messy operations resulting therefrom. This principle applies to all
dishes prepared in the kitchen.
