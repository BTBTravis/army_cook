erels weighing from 3% to 5 pounds and over, and turkeys, ducks,
and geese, are used for roasting. The whole drawn bird is usually
roasted and stuffed with any desired stuffing. Brush the skin of
the bird with melted or softened fat. Place in a slow oven (250Â®
F.), breast up, in an uncovered pan. Place strips of body fat re-
moved in dressing over the breastbone. Bacon or salt pork strips
may be used. Allow 25 to 30 minutes per pound.
