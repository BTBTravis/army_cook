Flour Water

The quantity of flour used will depend upon the quantity of liquid
to be thickened and the thickness desired. One quart of water, mixed
with 1 pound of flour will thicken to gravy consistency about 2)4
gallons of liquid. The thickness of the liquid will also depend upon
the length of boiling, after putting in the batter, as long boiling
evaporates more of the moisture and results in thicker liquid. Care
must be used in mixing the batter with the liquid as constant stirring
is necessary to prevent lumping.
