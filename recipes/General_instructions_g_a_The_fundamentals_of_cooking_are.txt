General_instructions_g_a_The_fundamentals_of_cooking_are
the same in field as in garrison. The chief difference is in the equip-
ment used. The cook must be familiar with the handling of wood
fires and the gasoline burner. Usually too much heat is used with
the gasoline burner and difficulty is experienced with the wood fire
when not accustomed to it. As the field range M1937 can be oper-
ated with wood in case of necessity, the cook should be trained in
the handling of both types of fuel.

&amp;. The menu must be adjusted to accommodate the range to be used
in the field. Part of the meal should be prepared on the top of the
range and part in the oven. This is especially true when either field
range No. 1 or No. 2 is used. The menu should also be planned to ac-
commodate the mess kit. Dishes that require long cooking should be
avoided when the cooking time is limited. Hot cakes should not be
served unless they can be served direct from the griddle to the man.
This requires time. Hot biscuits can be prepared in much less time
and can be served hot from the oven without difficulty.
