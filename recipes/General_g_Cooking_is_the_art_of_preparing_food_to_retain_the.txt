maximum nutritive value, while improving digestibility and palatabil-
ity, to the end that the soldier will enjoy his meals and still be ade-
quately nourished. Effective cooking takes into consideration the
characteristics of cereals, vegetables, fruits, spices, and meats; the
nutritive value and how to retain it; changes that occur in texture
and flavor; the functions of foods; and the possibilities of combining
one food with another to obtain variety and increased palatability.
As a cook gains experience, he learns to bring out attractive flavors
by blending and seasoning foods, and to complete his cooking just
before the food is to be eaten to preserve its attractiveness and nutri-
tive value. The cookâ€™s work is not finished when he has cooked the
food; he must also learn to serve it in an attractive manner. This
he learns to do by experience. There is no limit to what can be done
to improve a mess by thought and care in seasoning, attractive serving,
and inventing new combinations and mixtures of foods. The pleasant
task of cooking becomes doubly interesting to the cook who is not satis-
fied with merely cooking well, but takes advantage of every opportu-
nity of finding new and pleasing ways to prepare foods. To him
cooking is not just a task g it is a pleasure.
