Jams_jellies_preserves_and_fruit_butters_g_a_Jam_is
made from whole small fruits which are either mashed or cooked to
a pulp with sugar. Good jam is soft, tender, and jellylike in texture,
bright and sparkling in color, and of the same consistency throughout
the mixture.

h. Jelly is made from the juice of the fruit combined with sugar.

A good jelly is clear, bright, and tender. When cut, it has a clean
surface and does not stick to the knife or spoon. When turned from
the glass, jelly should hold its shape and should quiver but not
break.

c. Preserves are whole fruits or pieces of fruit preserved in a heavy
sugar sirup. A good preserved fruit is plump, tender, and bright
in color.

d. Fruit butters consist of the whole fruit cooked until tender and
then rubbed through a sieve to remove the seeds and skin. The
pulp is added to sugar and spices and cooked until smooth and
thick.
