THE ARMY COOK


If fresh pumpkin or squash is used, prepare and cook as in squash,
mashed ; if canned, cooking is not necessary. Place cooked or canned
pumpkin or squash in a large bowl or container. The pumpkin or
.squash must be smooth but not watery (if w^atery, heat until water
has evaporated). Mix sugar, salt, spices, and milk with the pump-
kin or squash. Beat the eggs and stir into the mixture and pour
into unbaked pie shells. Bake in a quick oven (400°-450® F. g
9 to 12 counts) for the first 20 minutes, then lower to a slow oven
( 200°-2r»0° F. g 18 to 20 counts) and continue for 40 minutes longer.
When completely baked, the filling is firm and does not stick to a
knife blade, and the edge of the crust is a golden brown. If the
filling shrinks unduly, it was too moist.
