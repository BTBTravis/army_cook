Mix sugar and cornstarch, stir into the boiling water and boil until
slightly thickened. Add butter, flavoring, and salt, and cook until of
desired thickness, which will depend upon use. This sauce may be
made richer by using milk in place of all or a part of the water. Varia-
tions of this sauce may also be made by adding cooked fruit (run
through a grinder) or by caramelization of part of the sugar.
