the material necessary for repairing the wear and tear of the soft
tissue and for building new tissue. All proteins are made up of
amino acids (building stones), some of which are essential to growth
and the maintenance of life. All proteins are not of equal value,
for they contain amino acids in different combinations. The proteins
that contain all of the essential amino acids are called “complete”
proteins. Some proteins containing little or none of some one essen-
tial amino acid are called “incomplete” proteins. It is necessary to
keep this in mind in selecting the proteins for an adequate diet. It is
wise to choose protein from animal sources for the larger part of the
protein intake for these are complete proteins. Meat, fish, eggs, and
milk products contain proteins of good quality, while legumes, breads,
and cereals contain proteins which are less valuable for tissue-build-
