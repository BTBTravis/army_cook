while being cooked. When the clear drippings are served without
the addition of other ingredients it is known as “natural gravy” and
is usually served with the meat. For a brown gravy, flour is added
to the drippings and fried until brown. Then meat stock, water, or
milk, is added, a little at a time, and stirred continuously until the
desired thickness of gravy is had. The quantity of flour and liquid
added to the drippings regulates the amount of gravy and its con-
sistency. Greasy gravy can be avoided by using only the amount of
drippings necessary and the use of suflicient flour to absorb all the
drippings before adding the liquids. When the quantity of drippings
is insufficient, additional fat may be added to the drippings.
