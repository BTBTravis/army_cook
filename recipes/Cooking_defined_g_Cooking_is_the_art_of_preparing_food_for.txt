the nourishment of the body. In its modern aspect, cooking is both
an art and a science. It is an art because it requires special skill in
design, color, attractive form, and service. It is a science because
exact knowledge is necessary in determining the correct time and
amount of heat needed by the food material to preserve maximum
nutritive value and to make it palatable and digestible, and thus aid
in the accomplishment of an adequate diet.
