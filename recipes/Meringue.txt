Meringue

(For 17 pies, 9-inch)

34 egg whites 1 pound sugar

1 ounce salt % ounce vanilla extract

Beat the egg whites until they are foamy and white in appearance
and stiff enough to hold their shape. Sprinkle sugar over the beaten
whites and continue beating until the mixture is stiff enough to hold
in peaks. During the beating add the salt and extract. Spread over
pie filling with the aid of a smooth knife and brown on upper shelf
of a quick oven (400°-450° F. g 9 to 12 counts) . This requires about
15 minutes.
