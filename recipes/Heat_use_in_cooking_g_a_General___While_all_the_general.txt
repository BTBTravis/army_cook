Heat_use_in_cooking_g_a_General___While_all_the_general
operations of the kitchen are called “cooking,” the term applies par-
ticularly to the application of heat to the food. This heat creates new
flavors in the food and generally improves its edible properties and
digestibility. Heat, assisted by moisture, swells and bursts the starch
cells in flour, rice, and potatoes; hardens the proteins of eggs, fish,
and meats ; and softens the fibrous substances in meats, vegetables, and
fruits. The quantity of heat depends upon the required temperature
and the time of cooking as well as the size, density, and other properties
of the food to be cooked.

h, Temferatv/ree cend times of cooking . g (1) Tables showing tem-
peratures and times of cooking for different foods are given in the
appendix. On examining the table of temperatures, it will be noted
that they vary greatly for different foods. Best results will be ob-
tained by using the temperature indicated for each food. Further,
this temperature must be uniformly maintained during the entire cook-
ing period. It must be remembered that it requires time for the heat
to penetrate to the center of the article being cooked. If the tempera-
ture is allowed to rise suddenly, the outside may become scorched or
burned before the center is cooked.

(2) The proper temperatures and times for cooking are also shown
in the recipes for various foods and dishes given in Chapter 2. How-
ever, a study of the table and observation of a few rules will greatly
assist the cook in understanding this important feature of cooking.
A knowledge of these general rules will insure good cooking even when
recipes are not available. These general rules are given below :

(a) In oven.
