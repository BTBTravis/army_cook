80 pounds meat (beef, pork, or veal),

cubes

15 pounds potatoes

2 cans tomatoes (No. 3 cans) or 10
pounds fresh tomatoes

Place the meat, turnips, carrots, and tomatoes in a large pan. Sim-
mer until the meat is tender and then add the remaining vegetables.
Season with salt and chili powder, and simmer until vegetables are
done. All ingredients should be thoroughly cooked but not broken
into pieces. The liquid should cover all the solids by about an inch.
The stew is improved by a bunch of parsley chopped fine and added
just before serving; a few sprigs of parsley may be used for garnish-
ing. Serve hot with the vegetables whole, if possible. Any kind of
fresh meat and any vegetables may be used in this stew.
