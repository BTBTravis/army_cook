Stew_Irish


30 pounds beef, fresh, or left-over beef 1 ijound flour
20 pounds potatoes, peeled 2 gallons beef stock

5 pounds onions

Select cuts of beef suitable for stewing from less tender cuts and
dice into ^-inch cubes or smaller, cutting all about the same size.
Cook at a simmering temperature until nearly tender. Dice the po-
tatoes into 1-inch cubes, chop the onions, and add both to the meat.
Add beef stock or water to cover the ingredients in the pan about 1
inch. Season to taste with salt and pepper and thicken with batter
made of flour. Simmer until the vegetables are thoroughly done.
This stew is improved by the addition of 3 pounds of diced carrots
or turnips or three No. 3 cans tomatoes. To make a potpie out of this,
cover with a biscuit dough and bake in a medium oven (325°g 400° F.
12 to 16 counts). To improve the appearance, the dough may be
washed with a beaten egg, which will give a golden brown color.
Serve hot.-
