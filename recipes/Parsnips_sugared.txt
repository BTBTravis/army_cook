Parsnips_sugared

30 pounds parsnips 1 ounce cinnamon, ground

2 quarts beef stock Salt and pepper to taste

2 pounds sugar

Scrape and wash the parsnips thoroughly, slice lengthwise, and
place them in a well-greased bakepan. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Pour over them the beef stock. Cover the bakepan to
prevent evaporation. Bake in a slow oven (200°-250° F. g 18 to 20
counts) for about 1 hour, or until tender. Sift the sugar and cin-
namon together. About 5 minutes before taking out of the oven,
sprinkle this sugar-cinnamon mixture over the parsnips and replace
in the oven until the top begins to brown.
