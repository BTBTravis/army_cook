(Z&gt;) The eyes or lids should never be used as a fire door. This prac-
tice results in a dirty range top due to soot and coal dust being dropped
upon the heating surface, and causes unnecessarily soiled cooking
utensils. If the range is fired through an eye, excessive coal may be
dumped on the fire, and may pile up on the top of the oven chamber
and burn through the top of the oven.

(c) Only small amounts of coal should be fed to the range at one
time and coal should be added frequently. This will provide an even

heat and will result in a smaller consumption of coal. Allow the new
coal to remain on top of red coals until it has ignited. Then stoke the
fire, breaking up the fused new coal and mixing it with the red coals.

{d) After stoking, be sure that the fire is raked principally to the
front of the firebox. Do not permit ashes to accumulate against the
water back. This reduces the heat against the water back and results
in insufficient hot water.

{e) An intensely hot fire should never be maintained. Such a fire
is not necessary for good cooking; on. the contrary, it often causes
poor cooking, since foods cooked both on the top of the range and in
the oven may become scorched or overcooked. An intensely hot fire
also tends to damage hot water piping and warp the top sections of
the range.

(4) Ga^e and cleaning Army range No. 5. g (a) Ashes,  Empty the
ashpan as in (2) (a) above as often as necessary to prevent the ashes
from accumulating above the sides of the pan. When ashesyare allowed
to collect above this point, heat is intensified on the bottom of the
grate, causing it to bum out more quickly. Also, when ashes are
allowed to pile up against the draft door register, the draft is often
retarded.

(b) Care of top panels and range covers. g ^There are four top panels
on the Army range No. 6, each of which contains two range covers.
The position of these panels and covers should be rotated every day
or so to prevent them from warping.

((?) Cane of oven doors. g Allowing heavy boilers to remain for any
length of time on opened and unsupported oven doors will cause the
doors to warp or bend. If this occurs, the oven door will not fit flush
against the front sheet of the range, allowing oven heat to escape and
making it difficult to keep the temperature uniform.

{d) Polishing range. g ^The range may be polished by rubbing it
with a greased rag. This should be done, however, only after the
range has been cleaned and is absolutely free of carbonized food resi-
due, coal dust, etc., in its crevices and depressions as well as on its flat
surfaces. If rags are used, they should be only slightly greased and
after the range has been rubbed with a greased rag it should be wiped
over again with a dry rag to remove any excess grease. Grease con-
taining salt should not be used. If stove polish is used, it also should
be applied sparingly, and after the polish has dried the range should
be rubbed over again with a dry cloth or G. I. brush. A greasy cloth
applied daily over the entire range keeps it in better condition than
stove polish applied once a week.
