THE ARMY COOK


TM 10-405

6. (Added.) The plan of work should include a definite time
schedule so that the preparation of each dish on the menu will be
finished just before serving. This is of prime importance, because
the food is at its best as to nutritive value, attractiveness, and pal-
atability, immediately after it has been prepared. When foods are
allowed to stand after preparation, they undergo a continuous loss
in certain vitamins, fiavor, color, and consistency. This applies not
only to cooked dishes but also to salads, fruits, cold cuts, and other foods
which are served cold. The cook should determine in advance the
length of time required for each step in the preparation of the various
foods, and establish a timetable for each dish on the menu. He then
knows exactly when to start preparing the different dishes so that they
will all be ready to be served at the same time. The food for the whole
organization should not be prepared in time to serv6 a few men who
mess early, such as kitchen personnel or guard details. Such a pro-
cedure allows the food for the majority of the organization to stand
for long periods of time before serving. Either quantities of food
suitable for these small details should be prepared, or the time of eat-
ing be rearranged so that these men eat after the majority have
finished.

c. By having a definite plan of work a cook can reduce the number
of utensils used in preparation of the food and lessen the dishwashing
required.
