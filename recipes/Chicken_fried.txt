THE ARMY COOK


Fowls over 6 months old should not be fried. Eemove pin feathers
by singeing over hot blaze. Divide each chicken into about 10 pieces
(natural divisions). Fry in shallow fat, or in deep fat. If fried in
deep fat, dip each piece in the beaten eggs and then in the cracker
meal. If the mixture does not adhere to the pieces sufficiently, repeat
the operation. Drain well in a colander and keep hot until served.
In case older chickens are used, which are large and possibly tough,
fried pieces should be placed in a bakepan with about 2 inches of
water, the pan covered, and placed in a slow oven to steam for about
40 minutes.
