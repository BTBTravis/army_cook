Biscuit_baking_powder

16 pounds flour 6 cans milk, evaporated, diluted with

3 ounces salt 6 pints water, or 20 ounces powdered

11 ounces baking powder skim milk dissolved in 6 pints water

4 pounds fat (lard or lard substitute)

Sift the dry ingredients together three times and work in the fat.
Make a well in the middle and add all the milk at once. Stir until
mixed. This should make a soft dough, if not, add more milk.
Turn out on lightly floured board and knead, quickly for not more
than 1 minute. The secret of making good biscuit is in handling
the dough only enough to mix thoroughly. Boll out to one-half the
thickness desired in the baked biscuit, cut out with a biscuit cutter,
and place in bakepans just touching each other. Bake in a quick
oven (400®g 450° F.  ^9 to 12 counts) for 12 minutes or until brown.
Serve hot.
