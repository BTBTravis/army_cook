Care_and_use_of_deepfat_fryers_g_The_fryers_which_have
/' been installed in some mess kitchens are constructed on a scientific
principle which practically assures good products. Heat is applied
above the bottom of the cooking vessel. This results in having hot fat
above and cold fat below. All sediment and particles drop into the
; cold fat, thus preventing burning which would help to “break down”
fat. The thermostat should keep the fat at a constant temperature.
(Do not overload the fryer because this results in lowering the tem-
perature too much.)

а. Before using fryer. g Fill kettle with cleaning solution such as is
^ ' used in dishwashers. Set the thermostat to 250° F. Boil for 10 min-
utes. Kinse with clean hot water and dry thoroughly.

б. How much fat to use. g ^Fill with fat to a level just enough to cover
* food being fried. Heat slowly so that fat will not be scorched. Fat

. which is held at smoking point will become scorched.

c. Directions for frying. g ^When fat has reached the temperature

I indicated for the recipe being used, put food in the basket and lower

^ into fat. When browned, lift up basket, allow food to drain to re-

' move free melted fat, and then turn food onto brown wrapping or

I other paper which will absorb excess fat.

d. Fried foods in menus. g ^Fried foods are desirable only when they
are well cooked. Greasy, overcooked products are unappetizing and

slow to digest. Foods fried in deep fat should be a good color, crisp,
and palatable. Use temperatures and times given in the table below. *

Other foods which may be french fried are onions, french toast,
croutons, boiled sliced sweet potatoes, eggplant, cucumbers, and squash
which have been sliced and" dipped in batter.

e. How to deem fryer. g (1) The fat should be drained off into
kettle, strained through cheesecloth, or put to one side and allowed
to settle.

(2) Fill the frying pot with water, heat to boiling, and add from
3 ounces to 1 pound of good cleaning compound (depending on size
of fryer) .

(3) After boiling for about 25 minutes, shut the burner oflF and allow
to stand overnight, if possible.

(4) Drain and refill with water. Boil and drain.

(5) Refill with water, heat, and add from 2 tablespoonfuls to a
cup of vinegar, depending on the size of the fryer. Stir and allow to
stand a few minutes before draining. Refill with water and drain.

f. Reuse of fat. g Put strained fat in kettle and add fresh fat to
proper level. There should always be enough fat to allow the tem-
perature to remain reasonably constant.

Good care and intelligent use of a fryer insure its longer life and
better fried products.
