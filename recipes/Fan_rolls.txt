this gives four pieces. Cut each of these in half; this gives eight
pieces. Cut each of these in half and the result is 16 pieces, each
weighing 1^^ ounces. This method is quick and with a little experi-

Bound up each piece into a neat ball and put close together in a well-
greased bakepan. Allow to proof (rise) until about double in size
and bake for about 15 minutes in a medium oven (325°-400° F. g
12 to 16 counts). Serve hot.
