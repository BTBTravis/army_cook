Celery_salad

15 pounds celery, trimmed 1 pint vinegar

15 eggs 1 pint water

4 pounds potatoes, mashed 2 ounces mustard, prepared

2 pounds bacon grease or cooking oil 5 heads lettuce

Dice the celery fine and let stand in cold water. Hard-boil the
eggs, chop fine, and mix with the diced celery. Make a dressing as
follows : Mash the potatoes ; mix in slowly the bacon grease (or cook-
ing oil) with the vinegar and water; then mix in the mustard and
a little red pepper and salt to taste. The dressing should be of the
consistency of cream or gravy. Regulate the quantity of water to
get this result. Pour the dressing over the celery-and-egg mixture
and serve cold on dishes garnished with lettuce leaves.
