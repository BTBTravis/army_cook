Note. g It must be remembered that an oven count will vary according to the
individual and also vary as the hand of the person making the count is sensi-
tive or insensitive to heat. This is affected by the occupation of the man making
the count. Cooks and others accustomed to working in heat are able to keep
their hands in a hot oven longer than persons not accustomed to heat. There-
fore, the only absolutely accurate method of determining oven temperature is
by a thermometer. However, if no thermometer is available, the hand-second
method will give fairly satisfactory results.
