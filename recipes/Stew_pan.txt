Miy the beef, potatoes, and onions and season. Put in a well-
greased bakepan, spreading to a depth of about 3 inches and add suf-
ficient beef stock to cover the mixture. Bake in medium oven until
nicely browned. It should not be as watery as the ordinary stew.
All left-over potatoes, except fried, may be utilized in this stew.
Left-over parts of roasts and gravy may be used. Serve hot.
