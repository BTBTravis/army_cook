Custard_egg

2 gallons milk, fresh, or 8 cans milk, 40 eggs

evaporated, diluted with 8 pints 2 ounces salt

water, or 26 ounces powdered skim 24 ounces sugar

milk dissolved in 9 pints water 2 ounces flavoring extract

Beat all ingredients to a foam and pour into a well-greased bake-
pan. Bake in a medium oven (325°g 400° F. 12 to 16 counts) for 20
to 30 minutes, or until done. When done a silver knife stuck in the
custard will come out clean. If baked too long it will become watery.
Any flavoring may be used. Serve cold.
