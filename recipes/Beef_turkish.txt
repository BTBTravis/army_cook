Beef from the less tender cuts may be used for this recipe. Make a
batter of the flour and melted fat, adding the stock and onions to make
a gravy. Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes. Season with cayenne pep-
per, salt, arid a little garlic, roll in flour, and fry. After the meat is
fried, put immediately into the gravy and allow to simmer for 2
hours. While cooking it may be necessary to add a little more
stock. Meanwhile boil the rice and place around a platter, making
a nest in the center into which the stew is poured.
