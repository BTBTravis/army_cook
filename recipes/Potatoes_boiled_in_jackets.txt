Select and clean potatoes of uniform size. Soak them a few min-
utes in cold water, then put them in boiling water and cook until
tender, which requires about 40 minutes. When tender, drain off
free water. Do not allow potatoes to boil until broken as this will
cause them to absoib the water and become pasty and soggy. Re-
move the kettle to back of stove, allowing the steam to escape. The
cooking should be so regulated that they can be served immediately
when ready.
