rub them through a colander or coarse strainer. Sear the meat on

THE ARMY COOK


If the beef is lean (lacking in fat), it is well to cut about 2 pounds
of fat pork into strips, or use sliced bacon, and lay on top of the beef.
This keeps the roast basted. Pour the vegetables and their liquid
over the meat, together with any preferred seasoning. Cover tightly
and let it simmer slowly for 4 or 5 hours, turning twice. After the
meat is cooked, remove from kettle. Thicken the liquid remaining in
the kettle by adding flour, and pour it over the meat.
