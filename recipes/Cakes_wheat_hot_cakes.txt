12 pounds flour 36 eggs

3 pounds sugar pound fat, melted

4 ounces salt 1- can milk, evaporated

12 ounces baking powder 6 quarts water

Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Beat
the eggs and add to water and evaporated milk. Turn this mixture
into the sifted flour mixture and add the melted fat. Then beat
into a smooth batter. If the batter seems too thick, add a little more
"water or milk. Grease a hot griddle iron or clean stove top with
bacon rind or clean fat and pour out the batter, a spoonful at a
time. Cook until nicely browned on both sides. Serve hot with
butter or sirup, or both. Hot cakes should be cooked a few at a
time. If all the cakes required for a meal are cooked before start-
ing to serve, the first ones cooked will become tough and leather-Y.
