Cake_apple

15 pounds apples, fresh, or 2 cans ap- 1 pound fat (butter, lard, or lard sub-
pies (No. 10 cans) stitute)

1 basic sweet dough 1 pound raisins

1 pound sugar

Make in the same manner as coffee cake but place thin slices of
cooked, fresh, or canned apples over top of dough about 30 mimites
before baking. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and raisins if
desired, and bake in medium oven (325°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts)
about 30 minutes. Avoid too much heat, as this may cause the fruit
to become dry, or very ripe fruit to become mushy. Almost any
kind of fruit may be used instead of apples. Bring edges of dough
up around the side of the pan so as to retain fruit juice.
