Vegetable_cookery_g_a_General___The_method_of_cooking
vegetables will usually have a decided effect, either good or bad,
upon their color, odor, flavor, or nutritive value. In some vegetables
one method of cooking will preserve all these qualities, in others it
may be necessary to sacrifice one or two to preserve the third, but
it is never necessary to sacrifice all four as is frequently the case.
In general, vegetables should be cooked as short a time as possible.
