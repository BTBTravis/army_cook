60 pounds chicken (fowl) dressed,
undrawn

4 pounds flour


10 cans milk, evaporated, diluted with

Singe and draw the chickens, cut into fourths, place in pan with
the veal, cover with cold water, and boil until chicken meat falls off
the bones. Remove bones (be careful not to leave splinters of bone in
the finished product), dice the chicken meat and thoroughly mix with
the diced veal. Hard-boil the eggs, dice, and add to the meat.

Make a cream sauce using the butter, flour, milk, and broth from
the boiled chicken. Season to taste. Slice pimento into strips (thin) ,
add to cream sauce, and pour the sauce over the meat and eggs.
Serve on toast or mashed potatoes.

Note. g The addition of two No. 1 cans of mushrooms will improve this dish.
Also, any left-over cooked chicken which may be on hand may be used in place
of fresh chicken.
