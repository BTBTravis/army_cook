Same as for doughnuts but instead of cutting into doughnut shape,
cut off pieces of dough about 1^ ounces in weight and roll into a
ball. Make depression with thumb or any suitable instrument, drop
small quantity of jelly into this depression, and close by pinching
dough together. Let rise (or proof) about 30 minutes, then fry and
sugar in the same manner as for doughnuts.
