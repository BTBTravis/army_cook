Ham_simmered

50 pounds ham, smoked

Wash and scape the ham. If the ham is very salty, let soak for
several hours in fresh water. Then change the water. The water in
which hams are cooked should never be allowed to reach the boiling
point. Place hams in near-boiling water (enough to cover) and sim-
mer until the hams are properly cooked. This process requires about
20 minutes to the pound. If two or more hams are simmered in the
same vessel, the time of cooking should be computed on the largest
ham. Skim all the impurities from the water as they arise. Let the
hams cool in the water in which they are cooked.

Mold, if present, may be removed from ham by wiping with a clean
cloth dampened with vinegar. The water in which the ham was cooked
may be used to cook cabbage, spinach, etc.
