Pork_chops

60 pounds pork loin

Cut into chops about one-half inch thick and weighing from 3 to 5
ounces each. Fry in a bakepan without added fat until seared, then
cover pan until the chops are done. Use a high heat until chops are
seared, then finish at lower temperature as high heat after searing
will make the chops dry and hard. They may be breaded in flour
or corn meal and fried with added fat. Serve with gravy made from
the drippings.
