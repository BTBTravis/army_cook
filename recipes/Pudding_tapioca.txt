Pudding_tapioca

4 pounds tapioca 4 pounds ffuitT dried, stewed, and

4 gallons water, cold chopped

7 pounds sugar 18 eggs

1 ounce flavoring extract

Soak the tapioca 2 hours in sufficient cold water to cover; then
simmer until clear (until the “pearls” have disappeared) which will
require about 1 hour ; then beat or whip in the fruit, sugar, beaten eggs,
and extract while hot. Raisins, currants, or other fruit may be added.

If quick (granulated) tapioca is used, no soaking is required. Add
tapioca to cold water and bring to the simmering point. In about 15
or 20 minutes the granules of tapioca will have disappeared. Then
add other ingredients as shown for pearl tapioca.

Serve hot or cold with milk or a sweet sauce.
