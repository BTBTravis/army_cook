Beefsteak_hamburg

45 pounds beef, fresh (raw) 5 pounds onions

Salt and pepper to taste

Use meat from the less tender cuts. Run the meat through a
grinder twice. Chop the onions fine, using a sharp knife. Mix meat
and onions well and season with salt and pepper. Mold into steaks
about 3 inches in diameter and about one-half inch in thickness. Fry
on griddle or clean stove top. Serve hot with gravy, or in ham-
burger sandwiches.

This recipe will be improved by the addition of 12 eggs to the
meat-and-onion mixture.
