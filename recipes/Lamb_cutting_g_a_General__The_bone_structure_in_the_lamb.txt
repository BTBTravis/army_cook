Lamb_cutting_g_a_General__The_bone_structure_in_the_lamb
carcass is almost identical with that of beef. Wholesale market cuts
of lamb differ from beef, however, in form, size, and names. Since
lamb is light in weight it is seldom split into sides but is sold either
whole, or divided into from two to four wholesale market cuts. These
cuts may be as follows:

(1) Saddle legs and loin (unsplit).

Rack forequarters (unsplit).

(2) Long saddle legs, loin, and hotel rack (unsplit).

Triangle or stew_ shoulders, breasts, shanks, and neck (un-
split) .

Legs two legs unsplit.

(3) Loin unsplit.

Hotel rack unsplit.

Triangle or stew_ shoulders, breasts, shanks, and neck (un-
split) .

The lamb chart (fig. 13) shows the carcass of lamb broken into cuts.
Normally the shoulders, breasts, shanks, and neck are not separated
as shown in the chart but are sold in one piece as a triangle, stew, or
slug. The usual packinghouse procedure is to leave the first three
ribs in the shoulders and nine ribs in the hotel rack. One rib (the
thirteenth) is left in the saddle. Figure 14 shows the structure and
names of the bones. The solid lines show one method of dividing the
lamb into wholesale cuts.
