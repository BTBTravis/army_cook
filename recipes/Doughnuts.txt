THE ARMY COOK


Mix all other ingredients with the basic sweet dough, then let
rise for 20 minutes in a temperature of 80° F. Roll out into sheets
about inch thick and cut with doughnut cutter or form into Tarious
shapes as desired. Let rise again until about double in size, and fry in
deep fat at 365° to 370° F. Too stiff a mixture may cause the dough-
nuts to crack while frying.

After frying, drain and sprinkle with powdered sugar mixed with
a small quantity of cinnamon. Icing may be used.
