Noodles

3 pounds flour 9 eggs

1% ounces salt Milk or water to make a stiff dough

To prepare noodles, sift one-half ounce of salt with each pound
of flour, break three eggs into the sifted mixture, and mix with milk
and water until a stiff dough is formed. Roll the dough out until it
is about one-eighth inch thick, sprinkle a little flour over it, and roll
it up. Cut slices from the end of the roll about one-eighth to one-
fourth inch wide and spread on a board or cloth in the sun to dry.
