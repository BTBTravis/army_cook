Spareribs

55 pounds spareribs

Cut the spareribs into pieces of 2 or 3 ribs each. There are two
principal methods of cooking spareribs :

With sauerkraut . g Place the spareribs on a rack in a bakepan and
sear about 15 minutes or until nicely browned in a hot oven (450째-
500째 F. g 8 counts). Remove spareribs and rack and pour off drip-
pings but save these. Place 4 No. 10 cans, or 16 No. 2)4 cans, or 4
gallons of fresh sauerkraut in the same bakepan and pour the drip-
pings from the searing over the sauerkraut. Place the seared spare-
ribs on top of the sauerkraut, season highly by sprinkling with pepper,
salt, and a little ground sage, and bake in a slow oven (200째-250째 F. g
18 to 20 counts) for 1 hour. If the spareribs become hard and dry,
this can be corrected by covering the pan for the last 15 to 30 minutes
of baking and the steam will soften them. Any excess liquid makes
excellent soup stock.

'With cabbage . g Drop the spareribs into boiling water, then simmer
for 30 minutes. Bring the Avater to a boil again, drop in 50 pounds
of cabbage, and boil until cabbage is tender (about 20 minutes).
