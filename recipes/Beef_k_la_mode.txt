the beef, parallel with the grain. Insert in each slit one piece of bacon,
rolled in garlic and cayenne pepper, and one slice of pickle. Brown
meat on all sides in hot fat. Make a gravy of flour, fat, tomatoes,
and beef stock. Put the meat in a pan, pour the gravy over it, and
place the carrots around it. Cook in a slow oven (200°-250° F. g

Serve with hot gravy. The gravy should be very spicy, therefore,
season it well with garlic, bay leaves, or Worcestershire sauce.
