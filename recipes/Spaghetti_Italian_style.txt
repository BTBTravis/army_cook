Heat the oil or fat and brown the onions and garlic. Add meat, and
brown. Add tomatoes and catsup. Salt and pepper to taste. Sim-
mer until sauce begins to thicken and add paprika to give bright red
color. Put spaghetti in boiling salted water and boil 20 minutes or
until done. Drain spaghetti and run enough cold water over it to
make it firm and keep from becoming a doughy mass but do not chill.
Pour the hot sauce over it and serve. Grated cheese may be sprinkled
on top.
