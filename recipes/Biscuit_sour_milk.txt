THE ARMY COOK


Mix and sift dry ingredients. Work the fat into the flour mixture.
Make a well in the middle and add all the milk at once. Stir until
mixed. This should make a soft dough, if not, add more milk.
Handle dough only enough to mix thoroughly. Roll out to one-half
the thickness desired in the baked biscuit, cut out with a biscuit
cutter, and place in a bakepan just touching each other. Bake in a
quick oven (400°-450° F. g 9 to 12 counts) for 12 minutes or until
brown. Serve hot.
