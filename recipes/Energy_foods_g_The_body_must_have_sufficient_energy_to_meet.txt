the daily expenditure for work. This energy is supplied by the oxi-
dation or burning of energy-yielding foods. The energy require-
ment is spoken of in terms of the number of calories needed daily.
A calorie is a unit by which heat or energy is measured (similar to^
a degree on a thermometer), ^uscular activity increases the caloric
requirement of the body. ''An active soldier requires more calories
jL day than a soldier who is doing office work. Most of the calories
come from carbohydrates and fats, but protein also furnishes energy.

a. Carhohydrates. g Sugars, starches, and cellulose (bulk) are the
most common forms of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates include all
starches (breads and cereals, macaroni and other pastes, rice, potatoes,
cornstarch, puddings, etc.), and sugars and sweets (jams, jellies,
sirups, candy, cakes, pastries, etc.). In some foods, such as sugar,
bread, jams, jellies, or cakes, the carbohydrate is highly concentrated.
Even in small amounts these foods are rich in energy. Since carbo-
hydrates tend to satisfy the appetite, it might seem that these foods
could be taken to supply the necessary energy in a cheap form. If
this were done, the body would get enough energy but would lack other
essential nutrients.
