Beef_soup

7 gallons beef stock 2 pounds rice, if desired

5 pounds beef (shank, neck, etc.) 1 bunch parsley, if desired

2 cans tomatoes (No. 3 cans) Salt and pepper to taste

This soup may be made to best advantage on days when simmered
beef is served. After simmering the beef until done, take it out and
skim off the grease. Dice the beef very fine and add the stock and
tomatoes to the water in which the beef was boiled ; if desired, a little
rice may be added. Ten minutes before serving, add enough beef
stock to make 10 gallons of soup. Season to taste with salt and
pepper and serve hot. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
