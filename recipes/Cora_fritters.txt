Cora_fritters

2 cans corn, ciâ€™cam style (No. 10 cans) 10 pounds flour

or 15 cans corn (No. 2 cans) 5 ounces baking powder

24 eggs 2 gallons milk or water

'J'/j ounces salt

Beat the corn and eggs together thoroughly. Sift together the
salt, flour, and baking powder three times. Add a portion of the
liquid, then a portion of the sifted dry ingredients, stirring well.
Continue until the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed in, reg-
ulating quantity of liquid to make a thick batter which will just
drop off the spoon. A thin batter makes a poor product. Using
a large basting spoon, drop spoonfuls into hot fat and fry until
brown. There are two methods of frying : In hot fat about inch

deep; or in fat deep enough to cover the fritters. Serve hot with
sirup.
