Cake_spice


2^4 pounds fat (butter, lard, or lard
substitute)

7 pounds sugar
40 egg yolks
20 egg whites

5 cans milk, evaporated, or 1 pound
powdered milk dissolved in 4 pints
water


6 pounds flour, soft
4 ounces baking powder

1 ounce salt

2 ounces cinnamon, ground
1 ounce cloves, ground

1 ounce allspice, ground
1 ounce nutmeg, ground


Cream the fat and sugar. Beat the egg yolk with the creamed fat
and sugar. Moisten the spices with 1 pint boiling water and beat
into the creamed fat-sugar-egg mixture. Sift together the flour, bak-
ing powder, and salt three times, and add gradually, with the milk,
to the creamed mixture in such proportions as to make mixing easy.
Beat the egg whites until stiff, and fold carefully into the batter.
Bake in a medium oven (352°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts) for 40 min-
utes if made in the form of a loaf cake, or 25 minutes if made into
cupcakes. Keep the oven as near 375° F, as possible throughout the
baking. Serve plain or with icing.
