the menu. The next step is the assembling or the preparation of the
foods and other items for cooking. The third step is the cooking or
preparation of the food for service. The fourth and final step is the
serving of the food. By having a definite plan of work a cook can
reduce the number of utensils used in preparation of the food and
lessen the dishwashing required. A thoughtless cook often leaves a
trail of unnecessarily soiled utenSils behind him, thereby justly incur-
ring the resentment of the kitchen police. In order to work rapidly
and eflSciently, and to spare himself and others unnecessary steps,
the cook should first thoroughly understand the recipe upon which he
is working. He should read the menu for the day and make definite
plans for cooking and serving all the dishes and foods called for.
Nothing is gained by starting work without a well-laid plan. The
use of a little imagination and anticipation will avoid much unneces-
sary confusion and last-minute rushing. The cook should think of
what he has to do, remember how he did it before, and then try to
do it a little better than the last time. He should also observe how
others do the same things and be alert to adopt any time- or labor-
saving methods which he may see others use. Recipes should always
be consulted as a guide unless one is sure from long experience that
this is not necessary. All ingredients should be accurately weighed
and measured in order that uniformity in quantity, volume, and flavor
may be assured, and that proper and intelligent corrections or adjust-
ments may be made in preparing better dishes or larger or smaller
portions at another time.
