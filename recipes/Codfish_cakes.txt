Codfish_cakes

17 pounds salt codfish 1 pound flour, or 2 pounds cracker

17 pounds potatoes, mashed crumbs

20 eggs 2 pounds fat

If whole cod is used, soak, remove the bones, and pass through a
meat chopper. Mix with the potatoes and eggs, and season with pep-
per and salt. Mold into cakes weighing about 3 ounces each and roll
in cracker crumbs or flour and fry in deep fat. Serve hot with tomato
sauce. These cakes may be improved by dipping in egg batter before
frying; the batter is made by mixing 12 eggs and 2 cans of evaporated
milk diluted with 2 pints of water or 2 quarts of fresh milk, or 7 ounces
powdered skim milk dissolved in 1^ pints water.
