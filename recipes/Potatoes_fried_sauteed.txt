40 pounds potatoes, unpeeled 1 pound fat

Wash the potatoes and boil with jackets on until tender. When
cool, peel and slice crosswise. Season with salt and pepper to taste
and add sufficient hot fat to moisten. Spread over the bottom of
a well-greased bakepan to the depth of about 2 inches, and fry in a
quick oven (400°-450° F. g 9 to 12 counts) or on top of the range
for about 30 minutes. Serve hot. Care should be taken not to get
the potatoes too greasy. They may be friend in shallow fat without
first being moistened with hot fat, but must be carefully watched to
prevent burning.
