Sauerkraut_how_made

30 pounds cabbage, trimmed 1 pound salt

Remove outer green leaves and slice the cabbage fine. Place in a
barrel a layer of cabbage (about 12 inches) and sprinkle salt over
it, then mash with a wooden masher until mushy. Add other layers
of cabbage and salt until the barrel is full. After the barrel is filled,
cover the kraut with a clean cloth and then with a board prepared
to fit snugly inside of the barrel. The board should be placed on the
cloth and a 100-pound rock on the board w'hile the cabbage is fer-
menting. Let stand in a temperature of about 70Â° F. for 1 month.
If the kraut is made in warm weather, the amount of salt used must be
increased by ^ pound. In warm weather the ripening process will
be faster than in cold weather. When the kraut is ready for use it
will have a decided odor, but when not fully matured it will have an
odor somewhat resembling that of beer. The temperature of the
place where it is stored has much to do with the acidity acquired in
any given time. Each time wlien removing kraut from the barrel,
thoroughly wash cloth, barrel cover, weigh, and sides of barrel, be-
fore replacing. This should be done once every week whether kraut is
removed or not. Care should be exercised in the selection of a barrel
