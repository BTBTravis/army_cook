Beef_g_a_Importance_in_mess__Beef_is_a_very_important_food
in the Army mess. It is a universally popular food and forms the
main dish of many meals. For these reasons the Army cook should
have a good general knowledge of the kind and quality of beef sup-
plied for Army messes and of methods of cutting and use. This in-
formation is given in the following paragraphs.

h. Classes of coircasses available. g ^The classes of carcass beef are
steers (males castrated when young), heifers (young females), cows,
bulls, and stags (males castrated after they reach maturity).

c. Type of carcasses med. g ^The carcasses (sides and quaiiers)
desired for Army use are the beef (plump and meaty) type, as dis-
tinguished from the dairy (lean and bony) type. Carcasses of the
beef type carry a greater proportion of meat to bone, and the flesh is
of better quality. Army specifications permit the purchase of car-
casses and wholesale cuts from only steer beef. Heifer beef com-
pares very well with steer beef in conformation (shape and plump-
ness), development of the best cuts, and quality of meat. Steers and
heifers are more desirable than any other class of beef.

d. 'Weight. g K steer carcass used in the Army mess may weigh
from a minimum of 450 pounds to a maximum of 900 pounds. Each
side will weigh from 226 to 450 pounds. The average 12-rib fore-
quarter represents about 52 percent of the side and weighs from 115
to 235 pounds. The hindquarter, being 48 percent of the side, weighs
