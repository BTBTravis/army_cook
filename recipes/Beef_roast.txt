Beef_roast

55 pounds beef, fresh

This recipe is for cooking the tender cuts of beef. The less tender
cuts should be braised, if a roast is desired.

Cut the beef into pieces about 5 pounds each and wipe with a damp
cloth. Sear until all sides are well browned. If the beef is lean
(lacking in fat) , it is well to lard it with about 2 pounds of fat pork
cut into strips, or lay these strips over the top. Sliced bacon may be
used. This improves flavor and bastes the beef while roasting. Place
in pan with fat side up. Boast in moderate oven (325* F. g 16
counts) for about 1% hours (about 20-22 minutes per pound per
piece). If in larger pieces than 5 pounds, more time is required;
however, for 5-pound pieces the time of 1 % hours after searing should

not be greatly exceeded as roasting longer than this, or allowing the
roast to remain in the oven after it is done, tends to make the finished
roast dry and hard. Roasting should be started so that the roast will
be finished shortly before time to serve; for example, a roast for
dinner started about 9:30 AM will be ready to carve at 11:30 AM.
When done, carve into thin slices, across the grain. Remove all
chunks of fat, bones, and tendons, and render for soup stock. Serve
hot with gravy made from the roast drippings. (See recipe 122.)
