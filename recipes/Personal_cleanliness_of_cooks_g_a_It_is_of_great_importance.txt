wear at least daily, and oftener, if necessary, in warm weather. His
outer clothing must be changed as soon as it becomes soiled. Finger-
nails should be kept trimmed short and free from dirt. Regulation
haircuts are comfortable and sanitary and should be procured regu-
larly. Because any illness contracted by a cook or other kitchen per-
sonnel may be readily transmitted to the entire command, they should
immediately report any symptoms of illness, infection, or contagious
disease for medical examination and treatment. The cook must be
careful to avoid coughing or sneezing when this might carry germs
into the food. All cuts, scalds, or burns, no matter how slight, should
be treated immediately to prevent infection.

they are to prevent hair, dandruff, or dust from the cookâ€™s hair falling
into the food. White caps must be worn at all times when in the
kitchen and white caps and coats when serving meals.
