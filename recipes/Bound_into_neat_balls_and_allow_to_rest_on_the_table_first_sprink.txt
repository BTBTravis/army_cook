ling some dusting flour to prevent sticking to the table. By the time
the last of the dough has been rounded, the first pieces will be ready
for working into rolls. Place four of these pieces in a row. Use a
small rolling pin (a piece cut from a household size broomstick is the
proper size) and put a crease or dent in the middle of each piece. Then
brush across the creases with melted butter or a mixture of melted
butter and lard; then fold over, so that top fold is one-third shorter
than bottom fold. Seal the two folds together by pressing the top
lip, but do not apply enough pressure to knock down. Place in well-
greased bakepans about 2 inches apart, let proof (rise) until about
double in size, and bake in a medium oven (325®-400® F. g 12 to 16
counts). Serve hot with butter, jam, or jelly.
