squash, macaroni, etc.) are cooked at high temperature for
a short time. A quick oven (400® to 450® F.) is used and
the time of cooking is not over 1 hour.

Sweet dough products . g Sweet dough products (cinnamon
buns, coffee cake, etc.) and cakes, pastries, cookies, etc., are
baked in a medium oven (325® to 400® F.). These products
contain a high percentage of sugar and, because sugar will
caramelize (turn brown or black) easily in great heat, these
foods will scorch or bum on the outside before the inside

is cooked if they are cooked in heat greater than 400° F.
The time of cooking is not over 1 hour and usually less than
30 minutes.

3, Protein foods. g Protein foods (meats, beans, etc.) are roasted
or baked for a longer time than starchy foods, but the tem-
perature is lower. Meats are roasted in a moderate oven
(250° to 325° F.) or at simmering temperature (180° to
210° F.). Meats can be cooked at high temperatures (and
sometimes are so cooked by careless or inexperienced cooks),
but this impairs palatability and increases cooking losses
and nutritive value. Beans should be baked in a slow oven
as a high temperature toughens the skins.

(6) Frying . g ^All foods are fried at a relatively high temperature.
This is a necessity so that the hot fat will quickly seal the surface
and prevent grease penetration. In order to insure that the center
will be cooked before the outside has had time to become scorched,
fried foods are cut in relatively thin or small pieces. In other words,
a thick piece of meat or other food cannot be fried successfully if it
is to be well done. For these reasons (high temperatures and thin
pieces of food) frying is a quick method of cooking.
