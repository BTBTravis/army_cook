Vegetables_g_Vegetables_when_cooked_in_water_are_cooked

at boiling temperature, with the exception of dry beans
which are simmered. Vegetables are boiled only long
enough to make them tender. They should never be cooked
longer than this. A maximum of 15 minutes is required for
the leafy vegetables (as cabbage, spinach, etc.) and between
30 and 45 minutes for the starchy and root vegetables (as
potatoes, carrots, onions, turnips, etc,). During cooking
some of the nutritive value of food is dissolved in the
water. If this liquid is not served with the food it should
be used for soups, gravies, stews, or sauces.
