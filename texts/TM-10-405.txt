&amp;. (Superseded.) Army range No. 5. g (1) Description .  The Army
range No. 5 is installed in many kitchens which are located in
permanent barracks. Its entire exterior is made of open-hearth range
steel, hand hammered, and closely riveted. It is painted with a black
japan, which is baked on in an oven. The ca^st iron castings are made
of the best grey iron, smooth, soft, and well tumbled in a rattler, and
are free from core and surface sand, rust, and grease. (See fig. 18.1.)

(2) Firing Army range No. 5 . g (a) Cleaning grate of ashes .  ^To
dump ashes from the firebox, withdraw the grate locking key and turn
the grate over with the shaker. Betum the grate to its normal posi--
tion with the level side of the grate forming the bottom of the firebox.
Insert the grate locking key.

(&amp;) Starting fire . g To start the fire, lay crumpled paper on the
grate and add enough dry kindling to hold the fire for several min-
utes. Then open the draft door register, the direct draft damper, and
the flue stopper, and close the ventilator register. Ignite the paper
and replace the range panels and covers. When the wood is ignited
and holding fire, about one small shovelful of coal should be added.
After this coal has ignited, more coal should be added to build up the
fire. Finally, the direct draft damper should be closed. If this is left
open after the fire has been started, the oven will not attain a satis-
factory temperature.

(3) Maintaining proper fire. g (a) The fire should never be built
up higher than 2 or 3 inches below the level of the oven top or the
firebox lining. If the firebox is stuffed with coal, the following com-
plications may develop :

1. Decrease in draft efficiency.

2. Loss of heat on water backs, in oven, and other parts of the

range.

3. Greater accumulation of soot and ash duet around the oven

and in the pipes and chimney.

Jj.. Waste of coal and higher operating costs, because of incom-
plete burning of coal.

6. Heat intensified on the range panel and covers, making them
red hot and subject to warping or cracking under heavy
weights.

6. Cooking results below standard due to poor draft and heat
circulation.

(Z&gt;) The eyes or lids should never be used as a fire door. This prac-
tice results in a dirty range top due to soot and coal dust being dropped
upon the heating surface, and causes unnecessarily soiled cooking
utensils. If the range is fired through an eye, excessive coal may be
dumped on the fire, and may pile up on the top of the oven chamber
and burn through the top of the oven.

(c) Only small amounts of coal should be fed to the range at one
time and coal should be added frequently. This will provide an even

t


heat and will result in a smaller consumption of coal. Allow the new
coal to remain on top of red coals until it has ignited. Then stoke the
fire, breaking up the fused new coal and mixing it with the red coals.

{d) After stoking, be sure that the fire is raked principally to the
front of the firebox. Do not permit ashes to accumulate against the
water back. This reduces the heat against the water back and results
in insufficient hot water.

{e) An intensely hot fire should never be maintained. Such a fire
is not necessary for good cooking; on. the contrary, it often causes
poor cooking, since foods cooked both on the top of the range and in
the oven may become scorched or overcooked. An intensely hot fire
also tends to damage hot water piping and warp the top sections of
the range.

(4) Ga^e and cleaning Army range No. 5. g (a) Ashes,  Empty the
ashpan as in (2) (a) above as often as necessary to prevent the ashes
from accumulating above the sides of the pan. When ashesyare allowed
to collect above this point, heat is intensified on the bottom of the
grate, causing it to bum out more quickly. Also, when ashes are
allowed to pile up against the draft door register, the draft is often
retarded.

(b) Care of top panels and range covers. g ^There are four top panels
on the Army range No. 6, each of which contains two range covers.
The position of these panels and covers should be rotated every day
or so to prevent them from warping.

((?) Cane of oven doors. g Allowing heavy boilers to remain for any
length of time on opened and unsupported oven doors will cause the
doors to warp or bend. If this occurs, the oven door will not fit flush
against the front sheet of the range, allowing oven heat to escape and
making it difficult to keep the temperature uniform.

{d) Polishing range. g ^The range may be polished by rubbing it
with a greased rag. This should be done, however, only after the
range has been cleaned and is absolutely free of carbonized food resi-
due, coal dust, etc., in its crevices and depressions as well as on its flat
surfaces. If rags are used, they should be only slightly greased and
after the range has been rubbed with a greased rag it should be wiped
over again with a dry rag to remove any excess grease. Grease con-
taining salt should not be used. If stove polish is used, it also should
be applied sparingly, and after the polish has dried the range should
be rubbed over again with a dry cloth or G. I. brush. A greasy cloth
applied daily over the entire range keeps it in better condition than
stove polish applied once a week.

(e) Cleaning Boot from range.

1. Top panels and range covers. g Invert, and brush soot from

bottom.

2. Clean-out doors . g First scrape ash dust and soot with flue

scraper from the top side of the oven, and push it down the
space at the left side of the oven. Clean both right and
left sides of this space with a flue scraper. Scrape the
ash dust and soot thus collected out of the clean-out door
together with the soot collected on the bottom sides of the
oven.

(/) Stovepipe . g Clean soot from the horizontal stovepipes with a
broom or a mop, the head of which is covered with cloth or burlap.
Care must be taken not to disconnect stovepipe connections. Soot can
be partially cleaned from vertical stovepipes by tapping them lightly
with a broad, flat stick, taking care not to dent or disconnect them.
The outside of the chimney or stovepipe can be cleaned by frequent
dusting with a dry cloth. Occasionally it should be washed with soapy
water and polished with a dry cloth. To prevent rusting, the stove-
pipe should be polished as described in (&lt;f) above. In all cleaning,
care should be taken neither to disconnect stovepipe connections nor
to force pipes into elbows or connections in such a manner that the
draft suction is impaired or cut off.

{g) Mantel . g The back of the mantel, the mantel shelf, and the left
and right ends of the mantel have baked japan surfaces, and are
properly cleaned with soapy water. To polish, a dry cloth should be
used. Sharp abrasives or instruments that would scratch or crack the
finish should be avoided.

(A) Other parts . g The parts which are listed below are properly
and satisfactorily cleaned with G, I. or round-wire brushes: top,
bottom, and sides of bake oven ; top, bottom, and sides of warming
oven ; top, front, rear, and sides of range, excluding mantel ; and oven
rack. If spilled food or other residue has been burned in or carbonized
on these surfaces, it will be necessary to use a harder abrasive instru-
ment than the G. I. or round-wire brush. Flat steel brushes, emery
cloths, or sharpened hard-steel instruments such as cold chisels, or
sharpened steel spring leaves, will be found adequate for scraping sur-
faces. In general, no range can be considered thoroughly clean until
all dirt, food, and other residue are cleaned from the crevices and
spaces where various parts fit together ; also from screw eyes, and from
indentations and raised surfaces of name plates, reinforced edges,
hinge connections, and all other mechanical and ornamental features
of the range.

(5) Regulating Army range No. 5. g ^There are four appliances on
the Army range No. 5 by which draft and temperature can be
regulated.

(а) Draft door register. g The draft door register regulates the
amount of air circulating up through the firebox into the range^
thereby controlling the degree of draft necessary to force the burning
of the fire. The register is a sliding door which can be closed, opened
partially, or fully opened to diminish or increase the air circulation
and the burning rate of the fire. If sufficient draft does not develop
when the register is fully opened, the draft door itself can be opened
outward to obtain the maximum degree of draft.

(6) Direct draft damper. g The direct draft damper controls the
direction of draft circulation within the range. When the* damper
is closed, it causes heat to circulate entirely around the oven, entering
the stovepipe through the flue opening just below the bottom of the
oven. This action heats the oven on the top, bottom, sides, and rear.
When the damper is open, the heat is drawn directly from the firebox ;
to the flue opening in the chimney just above the top of the oven where I
the damper is located. Since heat is drawn up to the flue opening,
it does not circulate around the oven and the oven is described as having
only top heat. The direct draft damper should be kept closed at all
times, except when the fire is being started. If for some reason only
top heat is required in the oven, or if the oven is not to be used, the
damper may be opened. To close, the direct draft damper control is
turned counterclockwise ; to open it, it is turned clockwise.

(c) Ventilator register. g The ventilator register reduces oven tem-
perature. If during baking or roasting, heat increases above the de-
sired temperature, it can be reduced by “cracking,” or partially opening,
the ventilator register.- Also, when the oven has greater top heat than
bottom, these temperatures can be made more equal by “cracking” the
register. Except for these purposes the ventilator register should
always be closed.

{d) Flue damper. g ^The flue damper is used when the fire is banked
to diminish the draft suction through the chimney and to decrease the
burning rate of the fire.

(б) Inspection.^ Army range No. 6. g The following is a check list
which may be used for inspection ©f Army range No. 6 :

(o) Ashpit. g See h (2) {a) and 6 (4) (a).

(&amp;) Fire glow in ashpit. g K red glow appearing in the ashpit indi-
cates that the grate is free from an excessive collection of ashes and
clinkers. If there is no red glow, it is an almost certain indication that

6

TM 10-405
G a


TECHNICAL MANTJAL


accumulated ashes and clinkers in the bottom of the firebox are pre-
venting an effective draft. The fire should be stoked.

(c) Range top panels and covers. g The condition of panels which
do not fit properly on the range top, and covers which do not fit flush
in the panels, is often caused by the warping of panels and covers due
to overly long exposure to excessive heat. The panels should be
changed without delay, and the manner of firing the range should be
checked. See that the fire level is maintained no higher than 2 or 3
inches below the top of the oven. Also check under the range panels
to see whether the backbone which supports the panels has not become
disconnected from the panel frames and oven top.

{d) Accumulation of soot and ash dust. g Check the bottom of the
range panels and covers, the top and bottom sides of the oven, and the
clean-out compartment for accumulation. Soot and ash dust must be
cleaned from all parts of the range daily for continued efficient and
uniform performance.

(e) Exterior range surfaces. g The exterior range surfaces, must be
‘ clean and free from spilled coal, ashes, dirt, and food residue. This
includes screw eyes, cracks, and indented surfaces.

(/) Interior oven and warrrdng sv/rfaces. g Same as (e) above.

{g) Grate locking key. g Check grate locking key to see that it is
in place. If the key is missing, the grate may shift or turn when the
fire is stoked, causing the fire coals to fall to the ashpan.

(7) “T’rowJZe” check Ust . g (a) Fire not hwrning properly.  ^If the
fire is not burning properly, check the grate to see that it is not in-
verted. If the grate is inverted, ashes will not fall into the ashpan
and air can enter over the top of the fire instead of up through the
grate, preventing the free burning of the fire. Warped range covers
which permit air to enter above the fire also retard its free burning.
Stovepipe and chimney connections which have become telescoped
into the elbow or angle connections, thereby reducing the draft space,
will also handicap the free burning of the fire.

(6) No bottom heat in oven. g ^If the oven shows evidence of having
insufficient bottom heat, check to see that the range has been properly
cleaned of soot and ash dust, especially on the bottom side of the oven.
See that the direct draft damper, the ventilator register, and the clean-
out door are closed.

(&lt;?) Insufficient oven heat. g If the entire oven does not heat suffi-
ciently, check as in (b) above. Also check the oven door to see that
it fits flush with the front sheet.

(d) I nsufficient hot water. g ^If there is not sufficient hot water, check
as in (a) above; check fire level; check to see that there is no accu-

mulation of ashes against the water back; and check to see that no
hot water faucets are leaking in the sink.

(e) Oven overheated . g If the oven becomes overheated, it can be
corrected by opening slightly the ventilator register. Closing or par-
tially closing the draft door register will also help to reduce oven
heat.

(/) Heating surface of range too hot. g If the heating surface of the
range is too hot, close the draft door register. Check to see that the
ashpan fits flush with the front sheet, and that it does not allow air to
enter through the ash pit.

c. Other ranges. g (1) Army field range.  See paragraph 77.

(2) Electric. g The chief point to consider in using electric ranges
is to avoid damage to the heating elements through rough handling
and spilling of food on the range or heating elements. Any food
spilled should be cleaned off immediately.

(3) Gas. g If foods are spilled on the burners of gas ranges, the
holes will close up, thus cutting off heat. The burners should be kept
clean. If the gas range does not appear to be heating well, the matter
should be reported for the attention of a plumber who may be able to
effect improvement by adjusting the air supply to the burners.

e. (Added.) Care of meat hlocka . g (1) Clean cutting block or table
after each use. The block will be much easier to keep clean if blood and
moisture from meat are not given a chance to soak deeply into the wood.

(2) Use steel scraper and wire brush to clean block. These two
accessories are necessary to keep cutting surface of block clean and
sanitary.

(3) Scrape and brush block thoroughly at end of day’s work,
This will remove most of the moisture and allow the block to dry
out overnight. It assures an odorless, clean surface for cutting.

(4) Keep cutting head of block dry. Moisture from fresh meat,
brine, and blood soak into the wood, causing the block to expand and
the wood to soften. This also affects the strength of glued joints.
Therefore ;

(а) Do not wash cutting surface of block.

{h) Do not wash meat tools on top of block.

(c) Do not allow fresh moist meat to lie on block longer tiian
necessary.

(5) Maintain same bevel on edges of block that it had when new.
This will prevent splitting and chipping of outside boards.

(6) Turn block weekly. Every part of cutting surface will then

wear down evenly. .

kept in a container as airtight as possible, hindering the loss
of flavor and strength. Boasted and/or roasted and ground
coffee may be considered as a perishable commodity and
should be handled as such.

(б) Carefully measure quantities of both water and coffee.

(e) Never make more than enough coffee for one meal. g ^Warmed-
over and left-over coffee is bitter and has lost its aroma. However,
any left-over coffee need not be wasted; it can be served as iced
coffee at a subsequent meal.

(f) Use ground coffee only once . g Coffee grounds from which coffee

has been made should always be thrown away. Never use them the

second time. Coffee made from them is sure to have a bitter and

unpleasant flavor. This is true even if fresh roasted coffee and old

grounds are mixed. To mix fresh coffee and old grounds is a waste,

not a paving. i „ . . , ,

(g) Scour cof ee pot. g Unless thoroughly scoured and rinsed daily,
some of the spent grounds and oils of the coffee will stick in the corners
of the pot and impart a disagreeable taste to subseqjient brews. Do
not use this utensil for any other purpose.

(Ji) If hags are used, they should not he dried, neither should they
he washed in hot water. g ^Hot water cooks in the coffee stains through-
out the bag and, in subsequent brews, imparts a bitter and off flavor
to the coffee. After the bag is rinsed in cold water, submerge it in
cool or cold water until time to use it again.

(2) Coffee for cooks, gucard, and small detail , g ^It is the * * *
the mess table. Every mess should use a small utensil for the pur-
pose of providing good hot coffee for the kitchen detail, members of
the guard, etc., who desire coffee earlier or later than the regular
serving time for the organization. In making small quantities, use a
tablespoonful of ground coffee to each cup of water and add 1 table-
spoonful for the pot.

(3) Proper quantities (superseded). g Seven and one-half gallons
of coffee are sufficient for 100 men fqr one meal. This requires 7V^
gallons of water and 3 pounds of fresh roasted and ground coffee.
This proportion of' fresh roasted and ground coffee and water should
be used, regardless of the method of preparation.

(4) Methods of brewing. g (a) (Superseded.) Kettle method . 
Bring freshly drawn cold water to a boil. Place roasted and ground
coffee in 50-pound muslin coffee bag, sugar or flour bag, or other
similai' b.ag in the ratio of 1 pound of coffee to 2^ gallons water, leaving
sufficient room in the bag to permit free circulation of water through
the bag as well as expansion of coffee. Then tie the bag with cord
sufficiently long to. be fastened to handle of container or elsewhere to
assist in its final removal from the brew. Not more than 15 pounds
of ground coffee should be placed in one bag, as more would interfere
with the expansion of the coffee. For example, if 100 gallons of coffee
are required, place the necessary 40 pounds of ground coffee in three
separate bags. This will expedite the extraction and facilitate the
removal of the water-soaked bags of spent grounds, after completion
of the brew. Place the bag containing the coffee in the boiling water,
immediately moving container to back of the stove in order to reduce
temperature of water. Never boil coffee. Submerge bag containing
coffee with stick or paddle. Push bag up and down in water forcing
water to pass through the grounds. Lift bag out of brew in 12 to
15 minutes, permitting surplus water to drain into kettle and remove
entirely. Serve coffee at once. Watch temperature of coffee. Be sure


to keep it hot without permitting it to boil. The bag containing the
grounc^^hould immediately be emptied, washed thoroughly in cold

(d) (Added.) Um method.

1. When properly operated, good coffee can be brewed in urns
by using urn bags, Tricolator, Dripolator, or other brewing
devices. But usually equipment of this kind does not pro-
duce good coffee unless used to its normal capacity. It does
not provide the fiexibility to conform with varying troop
strength.

Small batches of 5 gallons of coffee cannot be made satis-
factorily in equipment designed to make large 20- or 40-
gallon batches. In such cases the insufficient quantity of
dry ground coffee in relation to the diameter of the dry
coffee compartment allows the water to go through it too
quickly, resulting in a weak brew. On the other hand, if
the diameter of a drip device is too small for the amount
of dry coffee used, the depth of grounds in the device re-
tards the free flow of water so that overextraction results.

3. When too much ground coffee is used in a device too small
for the quantity of the intended brew, the operation will
be delayed from a normal 15 to 20 minutes dripping period
to one of an hour or longer; also complete stoppage of
filtration may result. This stoppage may cause an over-
flow of water directly into the urn crock g ^water that does
not go through the coffee at all. This would produce a
weak brew. An overflow may also cause a water seal to
form where the drip device rests on the um, creating a
back pressure within the urn crock entirely stopping
further filtration.

coffee nearest to the water flow while the balance of the
charge remains dry, therefore unextracted. There is also
a probability that replacement parts or accessories may
not be easily obtainable, further interfering with the
proper functioning of urns.

5. Some devices will only function satisfactorily when their

component parts are securely interlocked into proper posi-
tion. Due to natural wear or mishandling, this may no
longer be possible. Such devices should be immediately
repaired or replaced as they may intermittently function
properly or clog up entirely, resulting in no coffee being
available at mealtime.

6. When any of the foregoing difficulties occur, a good brew

of coffee can be made in an um by using a bag containing
ground coffee as described in the kettle method in the
same ratio of 1 pound of coffee to each 2^ gallons of
boiling water, as follows: Put the bag containing the
coffee into the urn. When water in a pressure boiler
actually boils, the safety valve will blow off steam. In
a gravity um a thermometer will indicate the boiling
point, 212° F. When boiling point is reached, measure
required amount of water into um. This can be done
by drawing water out of the boiler and pouring into um,
or if siphon is used the amount of water transferred to
urn can be measured by watching the water gauge on th^
boiler. While the water is being added, stir bag contain-
ing grounds with stick or paddle. Push bag up and
down f orcing“water through the grounds. Baise the bag
out of brew in 12 to 15 minutes, permitting surplus water
to drain into the um and then remove entirely. Serve
coffee at once. Clean the um bag, using the method
described under kettle method.


{e) (Added.) EmergeTi&amp;y kettle or pot method {ru&gt;t to he vsed
in urns ). g Sometimes a bag may not be available. In this case
ground coffee in proper proportion to water is poured into the kettle
or pot when water reaches the boiling point after which the utensil
is moved to back of stove in order to reduce the temperature of the
water. During brewing period of 10 to 12 minutes coffee should be
stirred occasionally, after which a small quantity of cold water
sprinkled into the brew will settle the groimds. This, however, will
interfere with the use of a faucet if utensil is so equipped ; therefore,
operator should ladle out the coffee being careful not to stir up the

(/) (Added.) Coffee^ iced . g ^Iced coffee should be made exactly
as hot coffee, but twice as strong, viz : 2 pounds of coffee to 2^ gallons
of water to compensate for the dilution that will result when ice is
added. This does not mean, however, that 7^ gallons of double-
strength coffee should be brewed to serve iced coffee to 100 men. It
means that 3 pounds of coffee should be brewed with, say, 4 gallons
of water, after which the melting of 25 pounds of ice will supply the
required balance of liquid needed per mess.

(3) (Superseded.) One ounce of tea per gallon of water has

proved satisfactory for hot tea. This quantity will not be exceeded.

(4) One and one-half ounces of tea per gallon of water has
proved adequate for iced tea. This includes the water result-
ing from the melting ice. This quantity will not be exceeded.
Iced tea should be served in preference to hot tea when tem-
perature conditions permit.

(5) Bring the required quantity of water to a boil. Place the dry
tea in a clean cotton bag, tie the top, and drop the bag into the boiling
water. Tea expands in the water, therefore, leave plenty of room in
the bag for expansion. Allow the bag of tea to remain in the water
for 5 or 7 minutes, then remove it. If tea leaves are allowed to re-
main in the water longer than 7 minutes the tea becomes stronger
and bitter. Agitate the bag of tea three or four times during the

. period it is in the water. Stir the tea just before serving, to equalize
strength throughout. If not stirred the tea on the bottom of the
container will be stronger than that on top. Unlike coffee, tea may
be made several hours before serving, if kept in earthenware or glass
containers, as it does not lose its flavor and aroma. If lemons are
available, they may be sliced and served with the tea in lieu of milk,
for those desiring this.

(6) Tea to be used as an iced drink should be made in concentrated

form. Use the total required quantity of tea leaves, and one-fifth

the required amount of water. Prepare the same as hot tea, but a

sufficient time in advance to permit cooling. Just before serving,

add the remainder of the water, either cold water or chipped ice

or a combination of the two, and stir vigorously in order to equalize

strength throughout. Added lemon materially improves the flavor.

6. (Added.) The plan of work should include a definite time
schedule so that the preparation of each dish on the menu will be
finished just before serving. This is of prime importance, because
the food is at its best as to nutritive value, attractiveness, and pal-
atability, immediately after it has been prepared. When foods are
allowed to stand after preparation, they undergo a continuous loss
in certain vitamins, fiavor, color, and consistency. This applies not
only to cooked dishes but also to salads, fruits, cold cuts, and other foods
which are served cold. The cook should determine in advance the
length of time required for each step in the preparation of the various
foods, and establish a timetable for each dish on the menu. He then
knows exactly when to start preparing the different dishes so that they
will all be ready to be served at the same time. The food for the whole
organization should not be prepared in time to serv6 a few men who
mess early, such as kitchen personnel or guard details. Such a pro-
cedure allows the food for the majority of the organization to stand
for long periods of time before serving. Either quantities of food
suitable for these small details should be prepared, or the time of eat-
ing be rearranged so that these men eat after the majority have
finished.

c. By having a definite plan of work a cook can reduce the number
of utensils used in preparation of the food and lessen the dishwashing
required.

General 1

Importance of cooking 2

Purpose of cooking 3

Cooking defined 4


1. General. g Cooking is the art of preparing food to retain the
maximum nutritive value, while improving digestibility and palatabil-
ity, to the end that the soldier will enjoy his meals and still be ade-
quately nourished. Effective cooking takes into consideration the
characteristics of cereals, vegetables, fruits, spices, and meats; the
nutritive value and how to retain it; changes that occur in texture
and flavor; the functions of foods; and the possibilities of combining
one food with another to obtain variety and increased palatability.
As a cook gains experience, he learns to bring out attractive flavors
by blending and seasoning foods, and to complete his cooking just
before the food is to be eaten to preserve its attractiveness and nutri-
tive value. The cook’s work is not finished when he has cooked the
food; he must also learn to serve it in an attractive manner. This
he learns to do by experience. There is no limit to what can be done
to improve a mess by thought and care in seasoning, attractive serving,
and inventing new combinations and mixtures of foods. The pleasant
task of cooking becomes doubly interesting to the cook who is not satis-
fied with merely cooking well, but takes advantage of every opportu-
nity of finding new and pleasing ways to prepare foods. To him
cooking is not just a task g it is a pleasure.

2. Importance of cooking. g a. Good cooking is recognized the
world over as a fine art, and a good cook always commands respect.
Cooks who perfect themselves in their art are always in demand, and
many have acquired wealth and fame. The Army cook holds a respon-
sible position, as the health and contentment of troops depend largely
on the quality of the cooking for their mess. A good cook takes pride
in serving appetizing meals, in keeping himself and the kitchen clean
and sanitary, and preventing waste. When he takes an interest in his
duties and constantly turns out the best possible meals, it will pro-
mote health, contentment, and pride of organization in each soldier.
On the other hand, poorly cooked meals will do more to make soldiers
discontented than any other factor.

h. Food is a human need, and supplying meals frugally and well
must continue to rank as an art worth mastering by any Army cook.
That is why the Army maintains schools for training cooks, and why

attendance at these schools has become popular. There is a difference
between providing passable meals and meals that bring words of
praise from the members of the mess. Every healthy man is highly
pleased with a dish prepared by a master hand and is quick to praise
the man who made it. As the cook gains experience and uses his
imagination, he is able to produce each day culinary triumphs sur-
passing those of the day before. The same old dishes served in the
same old way day after day may be entirely wholesome at all times,
but they fail to arouse the interest of those who meet them at the table.
On the other hand, more than any other factor, poorly cooked meals
will breed discontent and will lower morale.

3. Purpose of cooking. g Some food is cooked to make available
a greater portion of nutritive value, to make it digestible and palatable
through the development of new flavors, and to destroy micro-
organisms.

4. Cooking defined. g Cooking is the art of preparing food for
the nourishment of the body. In its modern aspect, cooking is both
an art and a science. It is an art because it requires special skill in
design, color, attractive form, and service. It is a science because
exact knowledge is necessary in determining the correct time and
amount of heat needed by the food material to preserve maximum
nutritive value and to make it palatable and digestible, and thus aid
in the accomplishment of an adequate diet.

5. General. g Good health depends to a great extent on the kind
and amount of food eaten. The right food will provide: heat and
energy, material for building and repairing the body, and material
for regulating body processes. All foods contain some nutrients (car-
bohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, or vitamins) that contribute in
different ways to the needs of the body. No single food provides all
the essential nutrients. For this reason, a wide variety should be
selected so that a balanced diet will be assured. A diet to be satis-

factory must first be palatable. Good cooking and pleasing flavor,
therefore, are important for good nutrition.

6. Energy foods. g The body must have sufficient energy to meet
the daily expenditure for work. This energy is supplied by the oxi-
dation or burning of energy-yielding foods. The energy require-
ment is spoken of in terms of the number of calories needed daily.
A calorie is a unit by which heat or energy is measured (similar to^
a degree on a thermometer), ^uscular activity increases the caloric
requirement of the body. ''An active soldier requires more calories
jL day than a soldier who is doing office work. Most of the calories
come from carbohydrates and fats, but protein also furnishes energy.

a. Carhohydrates. g Sugars, starches, and cellulose (bulk) are the
most common forms of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates include all
starches (breads and cereals, macaroni and other pastes, rice, potatoes,
cornstarch, puddings, etc.), and sugars and sweets (jams, jellies,
sirups, candy, cakes, pastries, etc.). In some foods, such as sugar,
bread, jams, jellies, or cakes, the carbohydrate is highly concentrated.
Even in small amounts these foods are rich in energy. Since carbo-
hydrates tend to satisfy the appetite, it might seem that these foods
could be taken to supply the necessary energy in a cheap form. If
this were done, the body would get enough energy but would lack other
essential nutrients.

6. Fats . g ^Fats include all the shortenings, butter, cream, salad oil
and dressing, bacon, and other fat meats. Fats require a longer time
for digestion than do carbohydrates or proteins and therefore are of
special importance in delaying the sensations of hunger. A diet devoid
of fat is very likely to create an abnormal feeling of hunger a few
hours after meals.

7. Proteins. g Proteins must always be supplied in food to provide
the material necessary for repairing the wear and tear of the soft
tissue and for building new tissue. All proteins are made up of
amino acids (building stones), some of which are essential to growth
and the maintenance of life. All proteins are not of equal value,
for they contain amino acids in different combinations. The proteins
that contain all of the essential amino acids are called “complete”
proteins. Some proteins containing little or none of some one essen-
tial amino acid are called “incomplete” proteins. It is necessary to
keep this in mind in selecting the proteins for an adequate diet. It is
wise to choose protein from animal sources for the larger part of the
protein intake for these are complete proteins. Meat, fish, eggs, and
milk products contain proteins of good quality, while legumes, breads,
and cereals contain proteins which are less valuable for tissue-build-

ing purposes but useful when combined with animal proteins. Gelatin
is an incomplete protein which must be supplemented by another to be
as useful as a complete protein.

8. Minerals. g ^Minerals are present in the foods we eat. The
amounts are so small it is impossible to see them but they are abso-
lutely necessary for good health. They may be classified as both pro-
tective and building substances. Calcium is the mineral most likely
to be deficient in ordinary meals unless thought and action are taken
to see that it is supplied.

a. Calcium and phosphorus are necessary for strong, firm bones
and teeth, and to maintain the tone of various tissues. The richest
sources of calcium and phosphorus are milk, eggs, cheese, and some
green leafy vegetables.

h. Iron and copper help promote growth and prevent anemia. Iron
and copper are found in liver, lean meat, egg yolk, apricots, green
leafy vegetables, and whole grain cereals.

c. Iodine is needed for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland
in the throat. Without it, the disease of common goiter may occur.
Iodine is found in sea foods and in the water supply and vegetables
grown in nongoiterous regions. In goiterous areas iodized salt may
be used to supply the necessary iodine.

d. Several other inorganic mineral elements are also essential. They
are present in many of the foods people eat and there is little danger
of not obtaining enough of them. If milk, vegetables and fruits, lean
meats, fish, eggs, whole grain breads, and cereals are included in the
daily diet, all of the mineral requirements can be fulfilled.

9. Vitamins. g ^The vitamins are also minute substances which are
essential to life, growth and good health. Without them the body is
unable to function properly. They aid in the formation of bone and
teeth, the maintenance of the integrity of the tissues, and the utiliza-
tion of food. Vitamins aid the minerals in body-building and are
protective substances.

a. Vitamin A aids in maintaining a healthy condition in the respir-
atory, digestive, and urinary tracts, and is essential for good eyesight.
Foods that are major sources of vitamin A are liver, milk, and
other dairy products (especially summer butter), and leafy green
and yellow vegetables. It is the coloring matter, carotene, of the
latter foods, which is changed by the body into vitamin A. Vitamin
A, or carotene, is readily destroyed by exposure to the oxygen of the
air and by heat. It is important, therefore, to utilize fresh leafy green
and yellow vegetables as soon as possible.

h. Vitamin B as it was originally discovered is now referred to as
the “Vitamin B complex” because it has been found to be made up of
several vitamins. Vitamins of the B complex are likely to be lacking
in the average diet unless an effort is made to see that they are
included. They are water-soluble and may be lost by soaking in water
or discarding the liquid in canned goods. Some of them are readily
destroyed by heat when food is cooked too long.

(1) Vitamin Bi (thiamine) aids in the utilization of carbohydrates
and stimulates a good appetite.

(2) Vitamin Bj (riboflavin or G) aids in the utilization of food,
and helps to keep the skin, hair, and eyes normal.

(3) Niacin (nicotinic acid) is concerned in the prevention of pella-
gra. The best sources are meats, while legumes, whole grains, and
green vegetables also contribute appreciable amounts.

(4) Other recently discovered factors are also part of the vitamin B
complex. They are usually present in foods which are good sources
of the other B vitamins.

c. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) helps form strong bones and teeth
and helps keep the gums healthy and teeth firm. It is found chiefly
in citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits, etc.), tomato juice, potatoes,
cabbage, and other green leafy vegetables. Vitamin C is water-soluble
and is readily destroyed by heat and oxygen. The losses in careful
cooking may be as much as 40 percent. By careless cooking, the losses
may be so great as to impair the adequacy of an otherwise good diet.

d. Vitamin D aids in building sturdy bones and teeth. The best
sources of vitamin D are sunshine, irradiated, evaporated, or whole
milk, irradiated cereals, butter, and eggs.

10. Water. g ^Water is essential to all vital processes, including
circulation, assimilation, excretion, and body regulation.

11. Summary. g It makes no difference in what part of the country
a man may be. Everyone needs to obtain from his daily diet the same
five essentials: energy, protein, minerals, vitamins, and water. A.
diet which lacks any one of these essentials is not balanced. It is only
possible to have a balanced diet by serving a variety of foods. The
soldier enjoys variety, not only in the foods themselves but in methods
of preparing them. He wants foods that appeal to his eyes and his
sense of taste and smell; he wants to eat in pleasant surroundings.
His food should be wholesome and good to eat.

13. Purchase of foods for mess. g a. The cook is not required

to make purchases but may be called on to report what is needed.

He must remember that it is not necessary to carry a large stock of
food. It is especially important to avoid purchases of large quanti-
ties of those foods which spoil readily. Therefore, the cook should

become familiar with the keeping qualities of all the foods used in
a mess, not only to aid in preventing purchases of too large quanti-

TM 10-405

13-14


ties but also to insure that foods on hand are consumed before
spoiling.

h. All cooks should have a good general knowledge of the keeping
qualities of foods. They know that such foods as fresh meats, eggs,
fish, milk, butter, most fruits, and many vegetables do not keep
long and must be purchased in small quantities and consumed within
a short period. They must be on the alert to see that all perishable
foods are consumed before they have time to spoil. Allowing foods
to spoil is always inexcusable.

14. Inspection. g a. Although the quartermaster or veterinary of-
ficer inspects all foods when received, this does not relieve mess
personnel from the responsibility of inspection when received in the
mess. In the absence of the mess sergeant, it becomes the duty of
the cook on shift to receive, inspect, sign for, and properly store all
food items received, unless other definite arrangement has been made
by the organization commander.

6. Mess personnel should see that all food received in the mess is
clean, sanitary, wholesome, in full weight and measure, and of the
grade required by Government specifications. Food which is decom-
posed or rotten, insect-infested (wormy), moldy, musty, etc., should
not be accepted. While it is not expected that mess personnel be
experts in determining whether the grade is that required by Govern-
ment specifications, whenever it is suspected that food delivered is
below the required grade, the matter should be reported to the
organization commander. Discrepancies in weight, measure, or
count should be noted on the delivery ticket or invoice before the
foods are accepted. A few minutes spent in making the proper in-
spection of foods at the time of delivery will insure receipt of clean,
sound, and wholesome food and will result in an annual saving of
many dollars to the mess.

c. It is especially important to inspect for condition all highly
perishable foods, as meats, fish, poultry, fresh milk, fresh fruits and
vegetables, butter, eggs, etc. It is also important to inspect canned
foods to see that there are no swelled or leaky cans and to inspect
cereals to see that there are no insects or worms present. Examples
of foods which should not be accepted are slimy, foul smelling, or
bruised meats, fish, and poultry ; scabby or rotten potatoes ; wilted or
badly rusted lettuce ; scaly or spotted apples; bruised peaches; swollen
or leaking canned foods; and insect-infested or wormy flour or
cereals.

d. Accurate scales should be available in every mess. The Govern-
ment contracts for net weights, that is, the weight of the food with

weifrlit of the container deducted. A mess should not pay for some-
thing; it does not receive. The weight of wrapping paper, burlap
bags, cardboard containers, etc., should be deducted when checking
weights.

e. Meat that has spoiled usually has an unmistakable odor. Sur-
face slime results from the growth of bacteria on the surface of the
meat and follows exposure of the meat to too high temperature and
high humidity. Meat that is kept cold and dry does not become
slimy. Surface slime is not always indicative of spoilage. Wash-
ing or slight trimming usually removes surface slime and the meat
beneath the surface is found to be sound. Sourness (spoilage) near
the bone can be detected by the use of a steel trier which is inserted
into the meat near the bone and smelled as soon as it is withdrawn.
A knife with a polished blade might be used for the same purpose.
Deep spoilage may also be detected by cutting the piece of meat in
two and smelling the cut surface. Surface mold on meats is not
harmful. If mold is extensive and washed or trimmed away it
might impart a moldy flavor to the meat, but it is not harmful to
health. If any doubt exists as to the soundness of meat, a qualified
inspector should be consulted.

/. Spoilage of canned food is generally indicated by swelled cans.
The contents of a can with swelled or bulged ends or sides should
never be served. Starchy vegetables, as corn, pumpkin, squash, etc.,
sometimes spoil without swelling the can, but on opening the can
the spoiled condition is unmistakable, as the odor and taste are very
disagreeable. (See par. 37c?.)

15. Storage of foods. g a. General .  All foods spoil more rapidly
at warm temperatures than at cold. This applies especially to highly
])erishable foods, such as meats, fish, butter, eggs, milk, and certain
fruits and vegetables. Excessive dampness contributes to the growth
of mold and consequent spoilage.

1). RefHgeration g temperature.^ humidity., air motion.  (1) The
pur|&gt;ose of refrigeration in the mess is to reduce, by means of con-
trolled cold air, the growth and activity of factors which cause
spoilage. The refrigerator should be used only for highly perishable
items. Products placed in the refrigerator unnecessarily may cause
overcrowding and result in poor operation and unsanitary conditions.
Foods which are spoiled should never be placed in the refrigerator.
Excessive dampness may l)e caused by poor air circulation or spilled
liquid and is as undesirable in the refrigerator as anywhere else.

(2) The mess refrigerator should produce a storage temperature of
r)0° F. or lower, whether cooled' by ice or mechanical means. A lower

TM 10^405

15


temperature is more desirable and 40° F. may be obtained in refrig-
erators properly designed for that purpose.

(3) Care should be used when storing food in the refrigerator, in
order to avoid interference with the air circulation. Cold air is
heavier than warmer air, hence the air is naturally circulated down-
ward from the cooling coils or melting ice, and upward through the
storage space, continuing to the ceiling where it moves across to the
cooling section, is cooled, and again moves downward on another
cycle. Good air circulation is necessary to produce a refrigerator
temperature of 42° F., which is 10° above the melting point of ice.
Larger size refrigerators may be equipped with small electric fans
to make the air motion more positive and effective. In this design,
the air is drawn upward by the fan, through the cooling section,
and discharged across the ceiling where, due to its temperature and
weight, it moves downward through the storage space.

c. Operation of refrigerators. g (1) Keep the refrigerator clean by
frequent washing and wiping. Thoroughly scrub it out at regular
intervals, at least once a week with soap and hot water.

(2) Ice-cooled refrigerators, and so-called wet-coil mechanically
cooled refrigerators, are equipped with drain lines to carry away
water from melting ice and condensate. Keep the drain pipe open.
It should be disconnected and flushed out with hot water once a
week to remove accumulations of slime which will form. The drain
trap in the floor of the refrigerator should likewise be kept in good
working order. Provision should be made to drain away the water
outside the kitchen so that insect breeding is minimized.

(3) The doors should fit tightly all around. There should be no
uncovered openings in the floor of the refrigerator which will permit
the loss of cold air or the admission of insects. If repairs are needed,
report the matter.

(4) Keep the refrigerator doors closed as much as possible. Air
circulation is disrupted and cold air is lost with each opening of the
door.

(5) Do not place food in the ice compartment of an ice-cooled re-
frigerator. Do not wrap the ice with paper or any other material.
This interferes with the air movement over the surface of the melting
ice and reduces the air cleansing and refrigeration capacity of the
refrigerator.

(6) Hang fresh meat on hooks. Avoid piling. Do not hang meats
so that pieces touch each other. Where blood may drip from meat,
dishes should be placed underneath. Do not pack vegetables too
closely.

(7) Food carried too long will eventually spoil in the best refriger-
ator. Use all left-over foods as soon as possible. Avoid stocking an
oversupply.

(8) The ice compartment* of an ice-cooled refrigerator should be
kept well filled for best results. It should never be permitted to get
lielow one-third full.

(9) Do not expect any refrigerator to perform efficiently when
subjected to abuse of the foregoing rules, or if located in too close
proximity to cooking ranges.

d. Mechanical refrigerators. g (1) Mechanically cooled mess re-
frigerators may be of two different types :

(«) The so-called dry-coil type operates with a cooling unit tem-
perature which is below 32° F., the freezing point of water. Moisture
deposits on this surface in the form of frost. Although this type may
be adjusted to produce a lower refrigerator temperature, the wide
temperature difference between the cooling unit and the air of the
refrigerator causes a low relative humidity or dry air. Leafy vege-
tables, such as lettuce, spinach, and celery may be wrapped in a wet
covering to prevent wilting. Products high in moisture content, which
may pick up undesirable flavors, may best be placed in covered con-
tainers, although it is not considered good practice to tightly cover
products consisting of living cell structure, such as fresh fruits and
vegetables. Frosted coils should be frequently defrosted by means of
shutting down the unit, never by the use of hot water or by scraping
or chipping. Accumulations of frost reduce the cooling value of the
unit.

(&amp;) The extended surface wet-coil type operates with a cooling unit
temperature above 32° F., the freezing point of water. Moisture de-
posits on this surface in the form of drops of water. An electric fan
circulates the air of the refrigerator through this cold, wet surface
where the air is cooled and some cleansing effect is accomplished.
The excess water is taken off through a drain. Due to the narrower
temperature difference prevailing, the relative humidity in the re-
frigerator is higher and no difliculty should be experienced with wilt-
ing or drying out of products. The functioning of this type of
refrigerator is quite comparable to a well-designed ice-cooled
refrigerator.

(2) Ice cubes are frozen only in the units that operate at a tempera-
ture below 32° F., the freezing point of water. The water may absorb
undesirable flavors before it is frozen and these may be transmitted
when the ice cubes are used in food or drink.

e. Arrangement of food in refrigerator. g (1) The proper grouping
of products in mess hall refrigerators will promote sanitation, help
to prevent contamination from the absorption of unpleasant flavors,
and thus protect the original quality of the product.

(2) Two refrigerators are generally provided in each mess hall.
However, when only one is available, it should, if possible, be divided
and operated as two separate refrigerators.

(3) Fresh fruits and vegetables give off respiration gases (odors)
which in some cases are quite obnoxious. Fluid products, or those
high in moisture or fat content, readily absorb odors from other prod-
ucts resulting in off-flavors and loss of quality. Fresh eggs, butter,
milk, creamy lamb and veal, etc., are easily damaged in this manner.
Likewise, prepared foods, such as coleslaw, salads, gelatin (while
liquid), gravies, and sauces are subject to flavor damage. As an
example, the wet surface of a cut watermelon will become almost
inedible after being placed in a confined space with some fresh fruits
and vegetables.

(4) One refrigerator should be used only for eggs, dairy products,
fresh meat, and prepared or cooked foods of high moisture content
which are not highly odorous.

(6) The other refrigerator should be used for fresh fruits and vege-
tables and other products prepared or cooked, which are relatively
low in moisture content and distinctively flavored.

(6) Products in sealed containers may be placed in either refrig-
erator without becoming damaged or causing damage to other
products. However, it is not advisable to use covered containers for
other than cooked or prepared foods.

(7) Some perishable products need not be placed in the mess hall
refrigerators. It is seldom that products are carried beyond 2 or 3
days and the general supply room should be entirely suitable for these.

(8) The following is a list of products which ahovld always be prop-
erly plajced in one of the two refrigerators.

(&lt;^) Ice . g ^Where the refrigerators are mechanically cooled and ice
is to be carried in one, it is more desirable to place the ice in the second
refrigerator. The resulting increased humidity will help keep the
products fresh and crisp and the ice is also beneficial in that the melt-
ing surface absorbs and carries away to the drains organic gases devel-
oped by the products in the confined space.

16. Various kinds, qualities, uses, etc. g Army 'messes use many
different foods which are«supplied or are available in different forms.
Beef is supplied in quarters (fore or hind), wholesale market cuts, or
boneless beef, and may either be chilled or frozen; chickens may be
broilers, fryers, or roasters; flour may be hard or soft; milk may be
fresh, canned, or dried ; fruits and vegetables may be fresh, canned, or
dried. Most foods may be used in many different ways, either alone or
in combination with other foods. The several forms of the same food
may each require a different handling. The cook is greatly aided in
his work by a thorough knowledge of the foods which he prepares g
their kinds, qualities, uses, and nutritive values.

17. Meat. g a. General .  ^Meat is the flesh of any animal used for
food. Commercially, it consists of muscle tissue, connective tissue, fat,
and bone. Eklible glands and organs are also classed as meat, but may
be referred to as meat specialities, sundry meats, fancy meats, or
variety meats.

h. Kinds of meat . g ^The kinds of meat are : beet from cattle, veal
from calf, pork from hog, and lamb from sheep.

c. V (due in diet . g ^Meat supplies many of the essential food elements
necessary to make the diet adequate.

(1) Protein. g ^Meat, containing about 20 percent protein, is a very
concentrated source of this important food element. Meat protein is
of high quality, as all animal proteins are superior to vegetable proteins.

(2) Calories . g ^All meats contain fats in greater or lesser degree, and
have a caloric value varying with the degree of fatness. Some fat is
lost during cooking or the visible fat may be cut away before eating,

15

TM 10-405

17-18


THE ARMY COOK


and so the caloric value will depend upon (he method of cooking and
the personal preference of the individual.

(3) Minerals. g {a) Meat is a valuable source of two of the three
minerals (calcium, phosphorus, and iron) in which the average diet is
most likely to be deficient. Meat, although not a good source of cal-
cium, is the richest source of phosphorus, which is necessary in the
utilization of calcium.

{h) Meat is an excellent source of iron which is in a readily utiliz-
able form. Liver of all types has a higher content of iron than any
other food, pork liver containing three times as much iron as beef liver,
which is higher than calf or lamb liver. Iron is better utilized when
even a very small amount of copper is present. Meat supplies copi^er.
too, which aids in the utilization of iron.

(4) Vitamins . g Meats (particularly the glandular organs) are im-
portant sources of the B vitamins, among which are vitamin Bi (thia-
mine), vitamin Bg (riboflavin or vitamin G), and niacin (nicotinic
acid). Lean pork is especially rich in thiamine. Many of the B vita-
mins are destroyed by heat. Overcooking is, therefore, to be avoided.

d. Canned meat . g Canned meats are composed almost wholly of lean
meat, as most of the fat is trimmed away in preparation for canning.
Canned meat is, therefore, a good source of protein, phosphorus, iron,
copper, and the B vitamins, but is comparatively low in fuel value.

18. Meat cutting. g a. General .  (1) Every mess where meats are
cut should be equipped with a set of knives for various purposes ; how-
ever, meat can be satisfactorily cut with a knife and saw if kept sharp.
Butcher knives are best for cutting roasts and steaks. Boning knives,
including at least one with a short, narrow blade, are best for removing
bones. A saw is needed. A good butcher uses a cleaver very little. A
hand meathook is an aid in handling and boning beef. A hook is rather
inconvenient to one not accustomed to it, but it becomes indispensable
to one skilled or experienced in its use.

(2) A good job of meat cutting cannot be done with dull tools.
Saws, knives, and cleavers should be sharp. A butcher’s steel is used
only to keep the edges of knives straight, not to sharpen them. The
sharpening should be done on a grindstone and finished on a smooth
whetstone. Saws are sharpened by filing. Frequently the teeth of the
saw need setting to give them the proper angle. This requires special
equipment. The average person is not competent to set and sharpen
meat saws. Ketail butchers now rent sharp saw blades from tool
supply houses for a nominal charge. As the blades become dull they
are exchanged for sharp ones.

h. Uses of tools . g In cutting meat to the best advantage proper
tools are needed. Keep in mind that each piece of cutlery was
designed to do a certain job, therefore it is advisable for the cook
to study his meat cutting tools and use each piece for the work for
which it was intended. For example, the short, narrow, stiff blades
of boning knives were designed especially for cutting through joints
and for cutting close around bones in order to separate them from
the meat. Steak knives with long, wide blades were made to cut
steaks and roasts. Knives with thin blades, such as the french
sheer and roast beef sheer, are best suited for carving cooked meat.

c. Kinds of tools . g With few exceptions the following tools will
fill just about every meat cutting and carving need :

6- inch boning knife (straight).

6- inch boning knife (curved).

10-inch steak knife (scimitar).

10-inch steak knife (straight).

12-inch cook’s knife (Sabatier type).

12-inch roast beef sheer.

7- inch cleaver.

12-inch steel (smooth or semismooth).

22-inch meat saw.

Hand meathook.

Steel fork.

(1) Knives . g Sharp knives are essential for efficient work. Oneway
to keep them sharp is to use them only for the work they were in-
tended to do. For instance, a boning knife has a comparatively
narrow bevel along the edge. It will stand much more abuse and
hard work than a properly ground steak knife, which has a wide
bevel and a thin edge. Rule number one should be; “Never use a
steak knife for boning meat.”

(a) Sharpening . g ^Knives should never be sharpened on a power-
driven dry stone since this will remove the temper from the cutting
edge. A water stone or carborundum oilstone may be purchased at
a reasonable cost. Either of these make good sharpening units.
There also are combination units on the market. Some of these con-
tain two stones and some three, each of a different degree of coarse-
ness. The stones are securely fastened together on a revolving shaft.
The base of the unit is filled with a light oil.

The knife is first put on a rough stone, then on a smoother one.
Use the entire stone for sharpening the knife. In this manner, the
stone will not “hollow out” at a particular point. It is best to draw
the full blade, from heel to tip, across the full length of the stone

THE ARMY COOK


in each movement. Turn the knife over and pull back in the same
manner from the opposite end of stone. In this fashion the knife
is sharpened evenly and smoothly and the stone is worn uniformly.
When the knife has sufficient edge, clean the blade and handle
thoroughly before using.

(6) Steeling . g After the knife has been sharpened on a stone, use
a smooth or semismooth steel to keep it sharp. Imagine putting a
razor on a rough steel and you will realize why a smooth steel is
better than a coarse one for keeping a keen edge on a knife blade.
The following shows the easiest and most effective method of steeling
a knife (fig. 1) :

1. The steel is used to true the blade and keep the edge in per-
fect condition. Although there is a technique to
handling the steel, it is easily mastered with practice.

Hold the steel firmly in the left hand, thumb on top of the
handle, with the point upward and slightly away from
body.

3. Place the heel of the blade against the far side of the tip
of the steel (fig. 1(T)). The steel and the blade should
meet at a slight angle, about 26°.

% Bring the blade down across the steel toward the left hand
with a quick swinging motion of the right wrist and
forearm. The entire blade edge should pass lightly
over the steel (fig. 1(D).

3. Bring the knife into position again but with the blade
against the near side of the steel (fig. 1®)* Repeat the
same motion, passing the blade over the steel.

6. Alternating from side to side, a dozen strokes will true the
edge.

Put the' knife on the steel as often as the edge needs it. Aim to
have the blade sharp always.

(c) Care of knives . g Every first-class meatman takes a personal
interest in keeping his equipment in number one condition at all
times. The sharp edge of a knife, like a razor, can be dulled easily.
For that reason knives should never be thrown into a drawer with
other tools. A wood strip (1 by 2 by 12 to 20 inches long) can be
made secure to the bottom of a table drawer, first sawing notches
into it at intervals of 2 to 3 inches. These .cuts (notches) should be
made about 1^4 inches deep and of such width that a knife blade
will fit easily into them. Arranged in order in these notches, the
knives are readily available and at the same time the edges are pro-
tected. In many instances a knife holder is fastened to the side of

the meat block. This may be handier than the drawer arrangement,
but to protect the knives as well as the holder the knife handles
should not protrude above the edge of the block. Whatever method





is followed, it is essential that tools should receive the care and
attention they deserve. Government specifications provide good
knives. If cared for they will give satisfactory service for a long
time.

{d) Responsibility for knives. g Each cook should have his own
tools and the mess sergeant should make him responsible for their |
care and condition. If this plan is followed the tools are much more
likely to be in proper condition at all times. When several men use
the same knives there is no incentive for anyone to care for them.

As a result they are usually in bad shape. Even though the kitchen
has only a limited number of steak and boning knives, they should be
divided as equally as possible among the cooks. From the standpoint
of getting the work done, one sharp knife is worth more than six dull
ones; but until each cook is made responsible for his own tools the
Army cannot expect to find sharp knives in its kitchens. At the close
of work each man should check his tools with the mess sergeant, who
in turn takes charge of them until the cook returns to duty.

(2) Cleaver . g ^Use this piece of cutlery as little as possible. Unless
it is very sharp and used properly, the cleaver will shatter the bone
and fill the surrounding meat with tiny bone splinters. These
splinters not only cause inconvenience in eating but they are dan-
gerous. It may become necessary to rush some man to a hospital
because a bone splinter has lodged in his throat.

(3) Meat hand hook. g Although a meathook is inconvenient to
one not accustomed to its use, it is in reality a valuable aid in boning
meat. It not only saves time but it eliminates most of the danger of
cutting fingers in the boning operation.

(4) Metal mesh glove. g In addition to the meat hook, workers in
large packing plants have discovered that a metal mesh finger glove,
worn on the left hand, is a good protection against cutting fingers
while boning meat. The glove is made of a fine metal mesh which
is flexible and interferes in no way with the action of the fingers. It
covers the thumb and the first and second fingers. A strap on the
wrist holds the glove in place. It is a practical safeguard for anyone
who is boning meat.

(5) Meat saw. g A saw with a dull blade will not do satisfactory
work. Three blades should be available at all times for each saw,
one in use and two in reserve. When a blade loses its edge and set,
it should be replaced with a sharp one. When two blades are dulled
they should be exchanged at the commissary for two sharp ones.
Saws are sharpened by filing, and the teeth need to be set occasionally
to give them the proper angle to prevent dragging. This requires
special equipment. The average person is not competent to set and
sharpen saw blades. The standard saw with a 20- to 24-inch blade
is best for most commercial purposes. However, the small one
issued for field duty will answer in an emergency.

d. Keeping meat tools clean. g (1) Every piece of kitchen equip-
ment, especially that which comes in direct contact with food, must
be kept clean. Meat tools are no exception, but as long as wood
handles are fastened on metal, as is the case with most knives,
cleavers, and saws, the problem of keeping the tools in condition to
pass rigid inspection will continue to exist. Begardless of the care
exercised in manufacturing the knife, it is impossible to rivet two
pieces of wood to a piece of steel and not leave a crack or crevice for
dirt to collect. Boiling water is not the solution to the problem.
Hot water soaks into the wood, causing it to expand. As the wood
drys it shrinks. In a short time the handles are loose and the
cracks and crevices are bigger than ever.

(2) A good practice is to fill all the cracks around the handle with
plastic wood; then do not let the piece of cutlery lie in hot water.
There is no occasion for leaving a knife in water for any length of
time. The knife, cleaver, or saw can be kept clean by simply wip-
ing, then rinsing in clean water, and wiping with a dry cloth. The
preceding treatment not only will prolong the life of the cutlery, but
will help keep it in better shape for inspection.

19. Beef. g a. Importance in mess.  Beef is a very important food
in the Army mess. It is a universally popular food and forms the
main dish of many meals. For these reasons the Army cook should
have a good general knowledge of the kind and quality of beef sup-
plied for Army messes and of methods of cutting and use. This in-
formation is given in the following paragraphs.

h. Classes of coircasses available. g ^The classes of carcass beef are
steers (males castrated when young), heifers (young females), cows,
bulls, and stags (males castrated after they reach maturity).

c. Type of carcasses med. g ^The carcasses (sides and quaiiers)
desired for Army use are the beef (plump and meaty) type, as dis-
tinguished from the dairy (lean and bony) type. Carcasses of the
beef type carry a greater proportion of meat to bone, and the flesh is
of better quality. Army specifications permit the purchase of car-
casses and wholesale cuts from only steer beef. Heifer beef com-
pares very well with steer beef in conformation (shape and plump-
ness), development of the best cuts, and quality of meat. Steers and
heifers are more desirable than any other class of beef.

d. 'Weight. g K steer carcass used in the Army mess may weigh
from a minimum of 450 pounds to a maximum of 900 pounds. Each
side will weigh from 226 to 450 pounds. The average 12-rib fore-
quarter represents about 52 percent of the side and weighs from 115
to 235 pounds. The hindquarter, being 48 percent of the side, weighs

THE ARMY COOK


slightly less than the forequarter. The dilference in weight of the
forequarter and hindquarter in a 300-pound side will be about 12
pounds.

20. Beef cutting. g a. General.  In cutting beef carcasses consid-
eration is given to the suitability of different cuts for different pur-
poses. Lean beef is not all of the same tenderness. In general, the
muscles (lean meat) of locomotion used for work, such as walking
and running, are not as tender as the supporting muscles which are
found along the back of the carcass. Since the meat differs in
tenderness, the object of cutting beef is to separate the less tender
meat from the tender; and for the sake of uniform cooking, the thin
meat is separated from the thick meat. The less tender wholesale
cuts include the chuck, shank, brisket, plate, flank, and round. The
tender ones are the rib, short loin, and loin end. All cuts of meat,
however, are tender when properly cooked.

h. Division of heef side into wholesale market cuts. g (1) ^The beef
chart (fig. 2) shows the entire side of beef broken into wholesale cuts.
This chart is especially valuable since it shows the location of each
wholesale cut in relationship to the full side. It will be noticed that
the hindquarter includes the round, rump, loin end, short loin, and
flank. The forequarter cuts are rib, chuck, shank, brisket, and plate.

(2) Figure 3 shows the location, structure, and names of the bones
in a side of beef. The solid lines show the division of the whole-
sale cuts as illustrated in figure 2. It will be noted that the side
of beef has 13 ribs. These are numbered from 1 to 13, beginning at
the front end. The hindquarter and forequarter are usually sepa-
rated between the twelfth and thirteenth ribs. The chuck contains
parts of the first 5 ribs. This leaves parts of 7 ribs, from the sixth
to the twelfth, inclusive, in the wholesale market rib.

c. Gutting carcass heef. g For the most part, carcass beef, as well
as wholesale market cuts, can be used to best advantage in the Army
mess if it is first boned. When cut this way the various muscles can
be separated and cooked according to the method designed to make
them most tender and palatable. In addition, the boneless cuts will
be easier to carve after they are cooked. A great deal of study was
given to developing the method of cutting described in the following
paragraphs. Dozens of carcasses of beef were cut up in every con-
ceivable manner in order to develop a style that would be easy to
follow, and at the same time would provide a maximum number of
good solid pieces of meat suitable for a variety of cooking methods.
It is recommended, therefore, that the Army cook follow carefully
the instructions given here in order to get the greatest amount of

usable meat from a side of beef. Incidentally, this method of cut-
ting will produce the same kind of boneless cuts as the Army will
be purchasing for its standard menus.

d. Gutting forequarter . g ^The forequarter is placed on the block
with the meat side down. In this position the backbone, breastbone,
and ribs are in plain sight, thus simplifying the job of cutting
around them.

(1) Pull the wooden or metal pin from the beef neck, if present.

(2) Un joint and remove the atlas joints. This is the first vertebra
of the neck.

(3) Trim the bloody meat from the throat side of the neck.

(4) Remove loose heart fat which lies beside the breastbone, then
remove the thin meat which covers the rib cartilages attached to the
breastbone. Loosen brisket meat and fat from around the outside of
the breastbone.

(5) Cut a narrow strip from the thin edge of the skirt, or dia-
phragm muscle. Pull the thin papery membrane from the skirt and
plate meat. With the knife lying nearly parallel with the ribs, cut
under the skirt and over the rib cartilages, thus exposing all the
cartilages attached to the rib bones. The meat which has just been
loosened from the cartilages should be cut free from the plate meat.
Beginning at the breastbone, loosen the plate meat from under the
rib cartilages.

(6) Remove the boneless strip of meat which lies along the chine
bone of the chuck. Loosen the similar strip of meat from the throat
side of the neck bone.

(7) The feather bones, or spine bones, of the forequarter were
scored with a saw in the packing plant. Break and remove the top
or loose half of these bones, all along the back of the forequarter.

(8) Loosen with a knife and pull the back strap (ligamentous
strip) from the full length of the forequarter, starting at the rib end.

(9) Cut back under the remaining sections of the feather bones to
loosen these bones from the meat.

(10) Un joint neck bone where it joins the first rib vertebra. Cut
around and under the neck bone so that it can be lifted from the meat
in one piece.

(11) Separate the rib and plate from the crosscut chuck, leaving
seven ribs on the chuck (fig. 4, line db). This can be done easily by
sawing across the backbone and rib cartilage, between the seventh
and eighth ribs. One full cut with a sharp steak knife will separate
the two pieces of meat.

(12) Turn the rib and plate over, meat side up. Make a mark with
the knife, one-half inch from the rib eye, at each end of the rib. Cut
across the ribs joining these two knife marks to separate the plate
meat from the rib meat (fig. 4, line cd). Do not saw the ribs.

(13) Starring at this knife mark, cut along parallel to the ribs
and peel th4 plate meat in one piece from the bones, leaving the
intercostal muscles, or rib fingers, attached to the ribs.



Line ah shows where plate and rib are separated from the crosscut chuck leaving seven
ribs on the chuck.

Line cd shows where the plate meat is separated from the rib meat at the edge of the
rib eye.

Figure 4. g Outside skeletal view of forequarter.


(14) Next, cut closely to the ribs and lift the spencer roll from its
cradle of bones.

(15) Remove the rib fingers from between the ribs. This can be
done by running the knife closely along each side of the ribs. Loosen
the rib fingers from the plate side first, then turn the bones around
and work from the backbone side. Each rib finger will come out in
one piece.

(16) Turn the crosscut chuck over so that meat side will be upper-
most. Study figure 5 to see how the shank and arm bones are to be
un jointed from the blade bone.

( 17) With the rib side of the chuck away from you, start at the
end of the elbow bone a (fig. 5) and pull the knife toward you
until it strikes the arm bone at h. Turn the knife and run it along
the arm bone until it reaches the socket joint at c. At this point
the knife goes through the socket joint to separate the arm bone
from the shoulder blade.

(18) Eemove the meat from in front of the shank bone, starting
at point d (fig. 5). Cut to point e then run the knife over the top
of the arm bone to &amp;. Between points e and h and points c and f
loosen all the meat from the arm bone so that the shank and arm
bones can be lifted to one side. The meat attached to the shank
bone should then be removed.



Dotted lines show path knife should follow in removing shank and aim bones.

Figure 5. g Outside view of blade, arm, and shank bones in a seveii-rib crosscut chuck.

(19) Separate from the brisket the boneless meat that covered
the front part of the shank and arm bones.

(20) The shoulder clod a (fig. 6) is removed by first running
the knife along the side of the ridges of the bladebone. Next,
cut the meat free from the narrow end of the bladebone. Start
pulling the clod from the heavy end toward the back of the chuck,
at the same time cutting underneath the clod meat at the natural seam
which separates it from the brisket. Keep pulling and cutting until
the thin part of the clod has been pulled from the bladebone.

(21) Remove the thin layer of meat which covers the chuck tender
and neck muscles. This may be done by first lainning the tip of the
knife along the top of the ridgebone to loosen the meat at that point.

Pull the layer of meat toward the end of the neck, cutting along
the natural dividing seam as you pull.

(22) Lift out the chuck tender. See figure 6 for the location of
this boneless piece of meat that resembles the tenderloin. First,
run the knife along the ridgebone to loosen the meat from the bone.
Next, cut underneath the tender at the dividing seam, pulling as you
cut.

(23) Pull the boneless neck meat straight out in front of the chuck.
Cut it off at a point 2 inches in front of the bladebone and parallel
with the rib side of the chuck.

(24) The bladebone and cartilage attached to it can now be lifted
from the inside chuck muscle. Cut close to the bone so that a
minimum amount of meat will be left attached to the blade.

(25) Separate the thin brisket and rib meat from the thick back
meat by cutting between them at the edge of the eye of the inside
chuck muscle (fig. 7, line ah).

(26) Peel the brisket meat from the ribs by cutting closely to the
bones, leaving the rib fingers attached to the ribs.

( 27 ) Cut across the back muscle between the third and fourth
ribs. The object here is to separate the tender inside chuck meat
from the less tender neck meat.

(28) Cut closely along the ribs to remove the boneless chuck roll,
from the fourth to the seventh ribs, inclusive.

forequarter as described in (15) above for the comparable five-rib
plate section of the forequarter.

e. Cutting hindquarter . g The outside of the hindquarter should

(1) Remove the clod fat and flank in one piece. This is done by
cutting under the fat and fairly close to the meat of the knuckle
section of the round, then making a straight cut fi’om the front
edge of the knuckle to a point about 6 inches from the eye of the
loin (figs. 3 and 8). It will be necessary to saw across the thirteenth
rib.

(2) With the inside of the flank up, cut a thin strip from the
naval side of the flank, then peel the membrane from the flank steak
and flank meat.

(3) Beginning at the narrow end of the flank, cut and pull the
flank steak back as far as it will come easily. Cut across the flank
to separate the fat fi’om the meat. Remove the bone (part of the
thirteenth rib) from the flank meat.

(4) Tlie clod fat should be cut into thin slices which later may be
tied or laid on lean boneless roasts and pot roasts. This fat protects
the lean meat while it is being cooked and adds to the flavor and

d). Run the knife along the hind shank bone to remove the heel
piece (fig. 10, dotted line ef). The remaining shank meat can now
be trimmed from the shank bone.

(15) With the inside round up, trim off the surplus fat. Then
cut under and remove the tough membrane which covers the fat-free
section of the inside round (fig. 11, dotted line xw). Next, run the

loose meat from the boneless rump so that the resulting rump butt
will be a smooth, blocky piece of meat.

(19) The trimmed loin is on the block, meat side down. The
tenderloin should be removed first (fig. 12, point 1). To do this run
the knife close along the chine bone, then starting at either the rump
or rib end (whichever is most convenient, depending upon whether
the loin is from the right or left side) strip the tenderloin, with
the aid of the knife, from the inside of the loin. Cut close to the

Cut through the meat from the top side of the loin immediately
in front of the hip bone. Saw through the backbone to finish divid-
ing these two wholesale cuts (fig. 12, dotted line de). With practice
this separation can be made without a saw by making a cut with
the knife between the sacral and lumbar vertebrae, then breaking
the backbone over the edge of the block.

(21) The hip bone and backbone may be removed from the loin
end in one piece. The first step is to cut along the feather or spine
bones on the top side. Turn the piece over and cut closely around
the hip bone, then the backbone. Continue cutting until all the
meat has been loosened from these bones. Trim off loose pieces
of meat so that the boneless sirloin butt will be a smooth, neat-
looking cut of meat when you are through with it.

(22) The easiest way to remove the bones from the shell loin
(short loin with tenderloin out) is to separate the meat from the
feather or spine bones first. One continuous cut with a sharp knife
is all that will be necessary. Cut close to the feather bones the full
length of the loin. Now turn the shell loin on edge so that it rests
oh the backbone. With the aid of the knife, separate the loin meat
from the finger bones. The meat which remains attached to the
backbone is the most difficult to remove. This is where a good
sharp boning knife comes in handy. By carefully weaving the tip
of the knife around the processes of the vertebrae, most of the meat
can be detached from the bone and left on the loin strip. Cut the
flank meat from the loin strip on a line with the edge of the eye
muscle.

/. Beef cuts and their uses . g ^The wide variety of boneless cuts
from the side of beef may be used in a number of different ways.
Generally speaking, however, the most satisfactory results in cooking
will be obtained by using the tender cuts for roasts and steaks and
the less tender cuts for such dishes as pot roasts and stews, and
in ground form for meat loaf, patties, and chili. When buying
forequarters and hindquarters alternately it is often a good idea to
save the spencer roll (and chuck roll, if needed) from the fore-
quarter, to cook with the tender cuts from the hindquarter. The heel
and outside round from the hindquarter can be held back to cook
with the less tender forequarter cuts.. The following table shows
the use recommended for the various boneless beef cuts :

two men cut meat exactly the same way. As a result the figures given
here will not be identical to the yields you may expect in your
kitchen; but the following table will give a close approximation of
the number of pounds of meat you may expect from forequarters and
hindquarters of beef weighing from 125 to 180 pounds each.

i. Army honeless heef. g (1) This is carcass beef of Army specifi-
cation, class, grade, and weight, cut into wholesale market cuts in
accordance with specific instructions. The bones, excess fat, gristle,
and tendons are removed and the cuts of boneless beef separated into
groups according to their tenderness. The most tender cuts are
packed for use as roasts and steaks, while the less tender cuts are
packed for use as boiling or stewing beef, or for ground meat (ham-
burger, meat loaf, etc.). The larger cuts are individually wrapped
in waxed paper and the smaller cuts wrapped in imits of about 10
pounds. The wrapped meat is packed in fiberboard boxes coated on
the inside with paraffin. The meat may be chilled but is usually
frozen.

(2) Army boneless beef has many advantages over carcass beef.

All the meat delivered is edible and there is no waste in bones, fat,
or gristle. It requires no butchering except the further cutting for
steaks and stews. It reduces required storage space by 60 to 70
percent. It reduces weight by approximately 25 percent. It sup-
plies meat in cuts more suitable for definite purposes than would
be possible from the use of carcass beef.

(3) Frozen Army boneless beef should be thawed in the original
container, either in chill rooms or at room temperature. Seventy-

THE ARMY COOK


two hours or more may be required to defrost frozen boneless beef
in chill rooms, but at room temperatures the meat becomes sufficiently
defrosted for use in 24 hours. Frozen meat should not be defrosted
in water, either hot or cold. No deterioration will take place during
defrosting if tlie meat is kept wrapped and in the shipping boxes.
Beef does not have to be completely defrosted before it is used.
However, meat containing considerable frost requires a somewhat
longer time to cook. For the thawing of frozen meat in the field
see paragi’aph Zlg.

(4) Army boneless beef should not be confused with commercial
boneless beef which is made from lower grades of beef, largely from
cow and bull carcasses. Such boneless cuts are deficient in tenderness
palatability and food value, and should never be accepted for Army
boneless beef.

21. Wholesale market cuts of beef for small messes. g In
small messes where it is impractical to use beef in quarters, wholesale
market beef cuts are available. These should be of the same class
and grade required for carcass beef. Beef piirchased as wholesale
market cuts usually costs the organization more than when quarters
are purchased. However, certain cuts can be readily obtained that
will meet all the requirements of the mess at no increased cost. The
square-cut chuck weighs just a little more than half the weight of
the forequarter. The round weighs just a little less than half the
weight of the hindquarter. The square-cut chuck sells at an average
of 15 to 20 percent less than carcasses, and the round sells at an
average of 15 to 20 percent more than carcass price. These two cuts
when bought alternately will cost just about the same as carcass
beef, and will yield beef suitable for every purpose for which the
whole carcass could be used. They have the advantage over carcass
beef in having less waste because carcasses contain the skirt, flank,
kidney knob, etc., which have waste and are not easy to use to
advantage. Wholesale market cuts should be used in the same way
as described for those cuts under carcass beef.

22. Lamb. g a. General .  According to available figures approxi-
mately 93 percent of the lambs produced in this country are marketed
before they are old enough to be called mutton. Climatic conditions
in different parts of the country, combined with orderly marketing on
the }&gt;art of lamb growers and feeders, are responsible for making
quality lamb available the year around.

&amp;. Four classificationg . g The four general classifications of lamb
are : hothouse lamb, genuine spring lamb, spring lamb, and lamb.
Hothouse lambs are in the luxury class. Their sale is limited to a

few of the largest cities. Genuine spring lambs are from about 3 to 5
months old. Since practically all lambs are bom from December to
June inclusive, depending upon the climate in various sections of the
country, this means that genuine spring lamb is available from March
to November, although it is most plentiful from April to July.
Spring lambs are from about 5 to 8 months old. The bulk of these
lambs reach the market from July to December. The fourth classifi-
cation, “lamb,” refers to those which are from approximately 8 to 12
months of age. Most of these lambs come from the feed lots and are
usually available from J anuary to May.

&lt;?. ffow to identify. g (1) There is no definite age when lamb be-
comes mutton but there are certain features which characterize young
lamb, lamb, and mutton. Bones are the most important indication
of age. The bones in young lamb are soft and reddish in color. As
the animal becomes older the bones gradually harden, and at the same
time they lose their pinkish color and turn white. The “break” joint
in the lower fore shank bone is a sure means of identifying lamb.
This joint has four well-defined ridges. In young lamb the ridges are
smooth, moist, and red. As the lambrmatures this joint loses its color
and moistness. When the mutton stage is reached the break joint
cannot be broken. The forefoot must be taken off at the round
(spool) joint, immediately below the break joint.

(2) Lamb cannot be identified by its size. Excellent quality fed
lambs often weigh more than mutton. Improved breeding and feed-
ing are producing top quality dressed lambs which weigh as high as
60 pounds or more. A good indication of age, however, is the color
of flesh. In lamb the color varies from light to dark pink. The color
deepens as the animal grows older. In mutton the flesh will be dark
red. Lamb fat is softer than mutton fat. It is creamy white or
slightly pink. Mutton fat is whiter and more brittle.

d. Place of lamb in mess . g ^Lamb has a definite place in the Army
menu. It is easy to cut, cook, and serve. The meat is young and
tender. Its appearance on the table will be welcomed by the men
because of the variety it adds to the menu. The entire back section
(shoulders, rack, loin, and legs) can be cut into chops for broiling and
pan-broiling ; but probably the most satisfactory method of using car-
cass lamb in the Army menu is to serve it in two ways g lamb stew and
lamb roast. When used as stew, all surplus fat should be removed
from the meat. Roast lamb should be cooked well done or just
slightly under the well-done stage. The “fell,” that thin, papery cov-
ering over the lamb, does not need to be removed from lamb roasts.
It does not affect the flavor of the lamb and, when left on, it helps

to keep in the juices and hold the roasts in shape. The fell should
be removed from loin and rib chops.

23. Lamb cutting. g a. General.  The bone structure in the lamb
carcass is almost identical with that of beef. Wholesale market cuts
of lamb differ from beef, however, in form, size, and names. Since
lamb is light in weight it is seldom split into sides but is sold either
whole, or divided into from two to four wholesale market cuts. These
cuts may be as follows:

(1) Saddle legs and loin (unsplit).

Rack forequarters (unsplit).

(2) Long saddle legs, loin, and hotel rack (unsplit).

Triangle or stew_ shoulders, breasts, shanks, and neck (un-
split) .

Legs two legs unsplit.

(3) Loin unsplit.

Hotel rack unsplit.

Triangle or stew_ shoulders, breasts, shanks, and neck (un-
split) .

The lamb chart (fig. 13) shows the carcass of lamb broken into cuts.
Normally the shoulders, breasts, shanks, and neck are not separated
as shown in the chart but are sold in one piece as a triangle, stew, or
slug. The usual packinghouse procedure is to leave the first three
ribs in the shoulders and nine ribs in the hotel rack. One rib (the
thirteenth) is left in the saddle. Figure 14 shows the structure and
names of the bones. The solid lines show one method of dividing the
lamb into wholesale cuts.

6. Army method of cutting lamh. g In order that carcass lamb may
be used to the best advantage in the Army menu, a special method
of cutting was developed. This method utilizes the whole lamb as
two major cuts, the long saddle and the triangle. The long saddle,
which includes the legs, loin, and hotel rack, is used for boneless
roasts. The triangle, consisting of the shoulders, breasts, shanks, and
neck, is used for boneless stew. This method of cutting yields about
the right proportion of stew and roasts. One hundred pounds of car-
cass lamb will provide approximately 24 pounds of boneless stew and
35 pounds of boneless roast. If more roast lamb and less stew is
desired, either one or both shoulders can be rolled for roasting. When
one shoulder is roasted with the cuts from the long saddle, 100 pounds
of lamb will provide approximately 44 pounds of boneless roasts,
leaving 15 pounds of boneless lamb for stew. Of course, the entire

lamb could be used for either of these dishes, but the division just
described gives variety in the menu and is the most economical
method of using the carcass.

c. Cutting lanxb triangle . g These instructions will start with* the
full carcass since it is assumed that most lamb for the Army will be
purchased in carcass form. It is recommended that the triangles be
cut up for stew first, leaving the long saddles for a later meal. The
fat covering inside and outside the long saddles gives them the neces-
.sary protection for a few days of aging.

(1) Put the lamb on the block with the back up.

(2) Use the knife and saw to remove the neck at the point where it
joins the shoulder.

(3) Pull the fell and excess fat from the outside of the neck. Re-
move the neck bone in one piece. Pidl out the backstrap, then cut the
boneless meat into suitable pieces for stew.

(4) Turn the carcass on its side, breasts nearest the cutter.

(5) Start at the cod fat and cut through the uppermost flank to
about the middle of the thirteenth rib. Continue cutting over the
ribs to a point about 1 inch above the elbow joint, then cut straight
across the arm bone. Saw across the arm bone; then hold the flank
firmly in the left hand and saw across the ribs, following the cut made
with the knife.

(6) Remove the shank and breast from the other side of the lamb.
This can be done by dropping the saw blade on the first rib of the
lower breast (the position of the lamb is not changed) and sawing
parallel to the cut made in removing the upper breast. Saw through
ribs, arm bone, and meat from the first to the thirteenth rib, then
finish with a knife by cutting through the flank to the cod fat.

(7) Separate the shanks from the breasts. Pull the fell from the
shanks. Remove the meat from the bones and cut it into stewing
pieces.

(8) Take one breast at a time, with rib side up, and cut under the
uiaphragm muscle to expose the rib cartilages. Then slide the knife
underneath the rib bones and lift them out by guiding the knife
closely along the bones. Turn the breast over and pull off the fell.
Trim off all surplus fat. Cut boneless meat into pieces for stew.

(9) Turn the remaining section of the lamb on its back. Cut and
saw between the fifth and sixth ribs on each side of the carcass to
separate the square-cut shoulders from the long saddle.

(10) Separate the two shoulders from the ribs and the unsplit
backbone. Start with the arm sections of the shoulders up. Loosen

(he meat by cutting down toward the block alongside the rib bones,
then along the spine or feather bones, first on one shoulder, then the
other. Turn the shoulders over so that the arm sections are down.
Cut around the backbone from the top side to finish removing the
shoulder ribs and backbone.

(11) Pull the backstrap from the back sides of both shoulders.

(12) Work on one shoulder at a time. Place the shoulder on the
block, outside down. Open the shoulder from the rib and arm sides.
Cut back into the meat, parallel with the block, until the arm bones
and bladebones are exposed. With the tip of the knife cut along the
edges of these two bones. Unjoint and remove the armjbone. Scrape
the front end of the ridgebone, then pull out the shoulder blade.

(13) When the shoulder is to be used for stew, remove surplus fat
while cutting the meat into small pieces.

(14) If one or both shoulders are to be roasted, roll and tie, using
the rib side as the face of the roll.

d. Cutting long saddle . g The shoulders and the long saddle are
the most desirable sections of the lamb for roasts. The roasts from
the long saddle are the boneless rack, boneless loin, and boneless legs.

(1) Separate the hotel rack from the loin by cutting across both
flanks to the backbone, immediately back of the thirteenth rib. Com-
plete the separation by sawing across the backbone. There will be
eight ribs in the hotel rack, since five ribs were left in the shoulders.

(2) Place the rack on the block, meat side down and ribs pointing
up. Run the knife down, close to the ribs and feather bones, on both
sides of the rack. This will loosen the meat from the bones on the end
of the rack nearest the cutter. Turn the rack, end for end, and repeat
the boning process. The meat should now be entirely free from the
bones, and in two pieces.

(3) Remove the bladebone cartilages from the shoulder ends of the
two pieces of rack meat. Pull the backstraps from the meat and re-
move surplus fat.

(4) In order to make the boneless roll uniform in thickness, reverse
the ends of the two pieces of meat. Lay one piece of meat on the
block, fat side down. Lay the cut surface of the second piece on the
cut surface of the first piece in such a manner that the eye muscles
will touch each other. Roll and tie with three or four cords.

(5) Separate the loin from the legs by cutting just in front of the
hip bones.

(6) With fell side resting on the block, cut all kidney fat from the
inside of the loin.

(7) Lift the kidneys from the kidney fat.

' (8) With the tip of the knife loosen the tenderloins on each side of

tlie backbone. Slide the knife along the finger bones to roll the
tenderloins back over the flanks.

(9) Cut back under the finger bones, then down along the feather
or spine bones on each side of the backbone. When lifting out the
backbone be careful not to cut through the thin meat that connects
tlie two pieces of boneless loin.

(10) Fold the loin together and tie with three or four cords.

(11) Split the two legs. With the outside of legs up, saw length-
wise down through the center of the backbone and tail bone.

(12) . Bone one leg at a time. First, place leg on block with inside
of leg up. Cut away all surplus fat around the aitchbone and flank
side of leg.

(13) Cut through the stifle joint to separate the shank meat and
shank bones from the leg.

(14) Pull the fell from the shank meat. Trim the meat from the
shank bone. The shank meat will be used later ( (18) below).

(16) Remove the pelvic bone (aitchbone and hip) and the backbone
and tail bone. These bones can be taken out in one piece, although
the job is made somewhat easier when they are separated at the slip
joint (fig. 14). The first step is to loosen and roll back the tenderloin
so the hip section of the pelvic bone will be exposed.

(16) Unjoint the pelvic bone from the leg bone. Continue to cut
closely around the pelvic bone to separate it from the meat. Keep
cutting until the pelvic bone, backbone, and tail bone have been
removed from the leg.

(17) Split the inside of the leg open lengthwise to expose the
leg bone. Cut meat from around the leg bone so that it may be lifted
out. Also remove the kneecap from the shank end of the leg.

(18) Use shank meat to fill opening in leg where pelvic bone was
removed.

(19) Roll the boneless leg lengthwise and tie it into shape.

24. Fresh pork. g a. General .  Pork is seldom sold in carcass

form or in sides. Practically all hog carcasses are made into com-
i mercial cuts in the packing plant (see pork chart, fig. 15). The
heavy lines on the bone structure chart (fig. 16) show the division
i of the side into the major wholesale cuts. About 30 percent of the
pork carcass is sold fresh; the rest is made into cured and smoked
meats, rendered into lard, or manufactured into sausage. Demands
of the trade influence the way the side of pork will be cut and
used. Consequently, pork cuts cannot be classified definitely as those
which are always sold fresh and those which are always cured, be-

cause practically every pork cut may be cured, and under certain
conditions, is cured. On the other hand, some of the cuts which are
usually cured may be available as fresh pork.

h. Pointers about pork . g Most hogs are marketed under 1 year of
age, so the flesh is usually tender and the bones soft. In older hogs,
however, the meat will not be as tender and the bones will not be as
soft as they are in young pork. In general, the pork produced
in the United States is quite uniform, so there are fewer grades
than in other meats. The color of young pork is a grayish pink
changing to a delicate rose in the older animal. The flesh is com-
paratively firm and fine grained, and free from excessive moisture.
The lean is well marbled and covered with a firm white fat.

c. Place of pork in Army mess. g (1) There are several reasons
why pork is valuable in the Army mess. It has a high fat content
which makes it an excellent energy food. A meal containing consid-
erable fat “sticks to the ribs.” That is one reason why nothing is so
satisfying as a breakfast of ham or bacon and eggs. Pork is an out-
standing source of thiamine (vitamin Bj). This vitamin is needed
for growth; it aids in the utilization of carbohydrates; it promotes
the health of the body cells; and it prevents the disease, beriberi.
Pork is a universally liked meat. The per capita consumption of
pork and beef in the United States has been approximately the same
for many years. Pork is also valuable in the Army mess from the
standpoints of variety and economy. Sometimes the statement is
made that pork is “hard to digest,” but this is not true. Being some-
what fatter than other meats it may remain in the stomach for a
longer period; biit it digests in the same length of time as chicken,
and in common with other meats, it is completely utilized by the body.

(2) Pork should always be cooked thoroughly for the following
reasons :

(ff) Pork muscle (lean meat) may contain trichinae. These micro-
scopic parasites cause trichinosis in human beings. Fortunately the
trichina parasite is killed by thorough cooking. Well-done pork is

{h) The rich, delicious flavor of pork is developed more fully
when it is cooked slowly and thoroughly.

25. Preparing fresh pork. g a. General .  The preparation of
pork for the mess does not require much work because the cuts are
of a size and form that are easily handled. The usual fresh cuts are
shoulders, fresh picnics, Boston style butts, loins, spareribs, neck
bones, and at some seasons of the j'^ear fresh hams or leg of pork.

h. One roast from light shoulder. g When the pork shoulder weighs
less than 12 pounds it can be made into a single boneless roll that
will be the right size and thickness for roasting.

(1) Remove the shoulder hock, with knife and saw, from immedi-
ately above the elbow joint.

(2) Take the collar, or skin, from the outside of the arm section
of the shoulder.

(3) Turn the meat over so that the fat side rests on the block.

(4) Split open the shoulder from the arm and blade sides. Cut
into the meat, parallel with the block, until the arm bones and blade-
bones are exposed.

(6) Unjoint and remove the arm bone.

(6) Cut meat free from undereneath the blade so that this bone
may be lifted out.

(7) Fold the boneless meat into a long roll and tie securely.

c. Two roasts from heavy shoulder. g single boneless roast from
a shoulder weighing much more than 12 pounds is apt to be quite
thick. While it can be roasted, a better plan is to split the heavy
shoulder into two boneless roasts, as follows :

(1) Cut off the hock, close above the elbow bone.

(2) Remove the collar, or skin, from the outside of the arm
section.

(3) The fat side should be resting on the block. Split the shoulder
open parallel with the block; begin at the shank end and follow the
natural seam that separates the inside and outside shoulder muscles.

(4) Lift off the boneless inside muscle. Roll and tie.

(5) Open the remaining section of the shoulder from the blade and
arm sides. Cut through the meat until the arm bones and blade-
bones are exposed. Remove these bones by cutting the meat loose
from them.

(6) Roll the boneless outside muscle into a long, narrow roast.
Tie with a few cords to hold it in shape during cooking.

d. Pork steaks from shoulder. g ^When pork shoulders are selling
for several cents a pound less than loin, it is an advantage to serve
shoulder pork and steak occasionally.

(1) Remove the hock and collar as described in &amp; and c above.

(2) With the knife and saw, cut steaks about one-fourth inch thick
from the arm section of the shoulder. Fat side of shoulder should
be up. Start at the shank end and continue cutting until the blade-
bone is reached.

(3) Turn the remaining section of the shoulder (Boston style
butt) so that blade steaks can be cut at right angles to the arm

steaks that were just removed. Start at the end where the bladebone
is exposed. Use knife and saw to remove the steaks.

e. Cushion roast from the picrdc. g ^The picnic is the lower half of
the pork shoulder. It includes the shank and arm sections. The
bone structure in the picnic shoulder makes this cut a difficult one
to carve if it is cooked with the bones in it. Prepared as a cushion
picnic roast, this section of the shoulder will present no carving
problem.

(1) Remove the hock and collar as described in &amp; above. '

(2) “Tunnel” out the arm bone. To do this, cut around the ends
of the arm bone from each side of the roast. Removing the bone
in this fashion leaves a good pocket in the boneless arm meat.

(3) Take the skin from the hock. Cut the meat from the shank
bones. Grind the boneless meat.

(4) Fill the pocket in the arm section with the ground shank
meat. Tie two strings around the roast to help hold the ground
meat in the pocket.

/. Carving Boston hutt roast. g ^The Boston style butt is the top
half of the pork shoulder. The bladebone may be removed from
the Boston butt before roasting, but if this is done the meat does
not hold together very well when the boneless roast is carved. Con-
sequently it is recommended that the Boston butt be cooked with
the bladebone in it. After roasting, it is a simple matter to run the
carving knife under the blade and lift the bone to one side. The
few ounces of meat attached to the blade and the ridge of the blade
can be separated from the bone with a small boning knife. The
meat underneath the bladebone is one solid piece which will carve j
easily.

g. Boneless roast from porh loin. g practical way to use the
pork loin as a roast is to remove the bones before cooking. This
assures an easily carved roast.

(1) Strip the tenderloin from its cradle of bones along the back-
bone.

(2) Remove the small section of bladebone from the shoulder
end of the loin provided this is not a bladeless loin,

(3) Loosen the loin meat from the feather bones by cutting
closely along these bones the full length of the loin.

(4) With inside of loin up, separate the hip bone from the back-
bone by running the knife through the slip joint. Lift hip bone
from meat by cutting closely around it.

(5) Turn the loin over so that it rests on the backbone with the
loin strip next to the cutter. Separate the strip from the ribs and
finger bones.

(6) Cut across the center of the boneless loin strip to separate
the meat into two pieces of equal length.

(7) Lay the two pieces together, fat sides out, with the thick ends
at opposite ends of the boneless roast. Tie the two pieces together
with cords spaced about 3 inches apart.

(8) The tenderloin may be tied in with the boneless roast, or it
may be cooked separately. The backbone may be used for another
meal.

h. Boneless chops from pork loin . g ^The customary procedure is
to use a knife and cleaver to cut pork chops. Unless the cleaver is
very sharp, and the man who is wielding it skilled in its use, the
pork chops are very likely to be full of bone splinters; also a large
percentage of them will be thin on one side and thick on the other,
thereby eliminating all possibility of cooking the meat uniformily.
All of these difficulties can be overcome by using a saw instead of a
cleaver, or by removing the loin strip and tenderloin from the back-
bone so that boneless chops can be served.

(1) Steps (1) to (5), g above, describe the making of a boneless
loin roast and how to separate the tenderloin and loin strip from
the bones in a pork loin.

(2) 'The tenderloin may be cut into pieces about 2 inches in length,
then stood on end and flattened (frenched) with the flat side of a
cleaver.

(3) For attractive boneless loin chops, cut them in double slices.
The loin strip should rest on the block, fat side up. If chops one-half
inck thick are desired, make a slice that thickness, stopping the knife
before it goes entirely through the meat. The second slice should be
the same thickness as the first one, but cut all the way through the
meat.

(4) Open out the two pieces of meat. This cut is called a butterfly
chop.

i. Cuttim^ sparerihs into individual ribs . g ^The object of the fol-
lowing instructions is to show a practical method of cutting spare-
ribs that will not only provide attractive servings, but at the same
time will eliminate disagreeable bone splinters.

(1) Remove the breastbone with a knife by cutting through the
cartilages that connect it with the ribs.

(2) Slice between the ribs.

(3) It is recommended that each rib be separated from its neighbor
before cooking, but if desired, two or more ribs may be left attached
together.

(4) The important thing to remember is to avoid cutting across

the center of the ribs with a cleaver; the cleaver cannot help but
make bone splinters. Bone splinters are not only a nuisance but
they are dangerous.

j. One roast from light fresh ham. g K. light, fresh ham (leg of
pork) weighing less than 12 pounds, like a light shoulder, may be
made into a single boneless roll that will be about the right size for
roasting. The following steps illustrate an easy method of making
the boneless fresh ham roast:

(1) Kemove the hock at the stifle joint.

(2) With a knife, lift the skin from the outside. A “skinned”
ham will have only a narrow collar, while the outside of a “regular”
ham will be covered with skin.

(3) Trim meat from outside of aitchbone. Remove the aitchbone
by unjointing it from the leg bone and cutting it free from the leg
meat.

(4) Split the inside muscle over the top of the leg bone.

(5) Run the knife lengthwise through the inside muscle, with the
tip of the blade sliding along the cushion side of the leg bone. Cut
meat free from leg bone so that the bone can be lifted from the meat.

(6) Remove the kneecap from the shank end of the knuckle side
of the ham.

(7) Roll and tie the boneless meat into shape.

k. Two roasts from heavy fresh ham . g ^AVhen the fresh ham
weighs much more than 12 pounds, it is advisable to make it into two
boneless roasts. The two rolls will be uniform in size and of a
thickness that will be very satisfactory for roasting.

(1) Separate the hock at the stifle joint.

(2) Remove skin from outside of ham.

(3) Take out the aitchbone by unjointing it from the leg bone and
cutting it free from the meat.

(4) With the face or inside of the ham up, split it lengthwise into
two equal-sized pieces.

(5) The cushion piece will be thick in the center, and the end where
the aitchbone was removed will be fairly thin. Lay the thick part
of the cushion over the thin end. This is done by starting at the
shank end and cutting a layer of cushion meat that will be thick
enough, when folded over the thin end, to make the roll uniform.
Stop the knife before the cushion slice has been cut free.

(6) Tie a few cords around the cushion roast to hold it in shape.

(7) Remove the leg bone and kneecap from the knuckle half of
the split fresh ham.

(8) Tie with four or five pieces of cord.

26. Smoked meats. g a. General.  Smoked meats play an impor-
tant role in the Army menu, especially during field maneuvers when
refrigeration facilities are limited. Properly cured hams and bacon
cannot be classified as nonperishable, but they can be kept much
longer without refrigeration than could possibly be expected of a
piece of fresh meat. In the packing house the supervision of the
cellars and the curing of meat cuts is considered a very essential
phase of the plant operations, and it is work that requires close and
constant attention.

h. Curing and smoking meat. g For Army use bacon is dry cured
or dry salt cured. Hams are sweet pickle cured. After the curing
process is completed the meat is sent to the smokehouse. Here it is
himg in rows over smouldering hardwood fires.

c. Kinds of smoked meat. g ^The principal smoked meats are : hams,
bacon, picnics, shoulder butts, jowl squares, briskets, and beef ham
sets (dried beef). There are two styles of smoked ham: regular and
skinned. The regular hams are marketed with the outer skin and fat
remaining intact. The name “skinned ham” is self-explanatory. It
means that about half of the outer skin and part of the fat were
removed before the ham was smoked. Smoked picnics (calas) are
pork shoulders with the butt portion removed just beyond the knuckle
bone. Shoulder butts are boneless. They are made from the eye
muscle of the Boston style butt. The term “bacon” is applied to
smoked bellies, though jowl squares and briskets are sometimes re-
ferred to as bacon squares and bacon briskets. 'Canadian style bacon
is made from the boneless loin strip.

d. Quality of smoked meat. g ^Nearly all packers make from one to
three grades of most of the smoked meat products. The grade of
the finished product depends upon the curing method, quality of the
fresh meat, and the way it was trimmed. Fancy bacon and hams are
cut from the best quality pork and have smooth, thin skin and firm
white fat. The meat is fine grained "and bright colored. The bacon
is free from “seeds.” The lower grades are usually defective in one
or more of the preceding characteristics.

27. Cutting smoked meats. g a. General.  Smoked hams and
picnics are the only two cuts of smoked meat that will require much
consideration from the standpoint of proper cutting. Both pieces of
meat may be cooked unboned, but the bones complicate the carving
job. For that reason it is often advisable to remove the bones before
cooking.

6. Boneless smoked ham for "baking. g The following method of re-
moving the bones from the smoked ham is recommended for Army
use:

TM 10-405

27 THE ARMY COOK

(1) Use the knife to lift the skin from the outside of the ham,
provided it is a regular ham. If it is a skinned ham, remove the
collar and the skin that covers the shank.

(2) Remove the aitchbone by unjointing it from the leg bone and
cutting it free from the meat.

(3) The shank may be removed at the stifle joint, provided it can
be used to advantage in the preparation of some other dish; other-
wise it may be left attached to the ham. In (4) to (6) below it is
assumed that the shank is on the ham.

(4) Start at the small end of the shank and split open the top half
(face) of the ham by running the knife closely along the shank bone,
then the leg bone. Remove these bones as well as the small kneecap
bone.

(5) The shank meat is so much thinner than the balance of the
ham that it is advisable to cut off this meat and put it in the pocket
left by the removal of the aitchbone.

(6) Roll and tie the boneless ham before baking.

c. Slicing smoked ham. g Slicing an unboned smoked ham not
only involves a lot of work (unless the kitchen is equipped with an
electric meat cutter) but it is not the most advantageous way to cut
the ham into attractive servings. The method followed by most first-
class hotels and restaurants is a more acceptable one.

(1) Take off the skin.

(2) Remove the aitchbone.

(3) Cut boneless slices from the meat that is exposed by removing
the aitchbone. The slices should be made diagonally across the end
of the ham until the leg bone is reached.

(4) Stand the ham on the cut surface of the butt end, with the
cushion side on the right. Start at the end of the shank and cut
down along the shank and leg bones until the block is reached. The
cushion side of the ham can now be sliced into attractive horseshoe-
shaped slices.

(5) Run the knife through the stifle joint to separate the shank
from the knuckle side of the ham.

(6) Cut closely around the leg bone so that this bone may be
lifted from the meat. Also take out the small kneecap bone.

(7) Turn the knuckle piece onto cut surface. Start at the large
end and cut the entire piece into boneless slices.

d. Boneless smoked picnic for baking . g ^The smoked picnic prob-
ably will be used largely for seasoning and baking. In order to get
the greatest number of attractive servings from this cut of meat, the
bones and skin should be removed before cooking.

(1) Remove the skin.

(2) With fat side down, split open the picnic, following over the
top of the shank bones and the arm bone as nearly as possible. Con-
tinue cutting until the meat has been freed from the bones and the
bones can be removed from the meat.

(3) Fold the boneless meat together and tie with cord.

28. Veal. g a. General.  Veal is the flesh of calves. Milk-fed veal
is considered best. According to Federal specifications, the minimum
weight of dressed veal for the Army is 75 pounds, maximum weight
190 pounds. The moisture content of veal is high and its protective
covering of fat is quite thin. Therefore, hanging or aging is not
advisable. It must be ordered fresh and used promptly.

h. How to judge quality of veal . g The shape or general build of
the carcass is the first thing to consider in judging quality of veal.
The same thing is true of other kinds of meat. Good quality veal
is plump and blocky; the neck and shanks are short; the rounds are
full; the shoulders thick; and the rib and loin well fleshed. The
carcass is thinly covered with clear, firm, white fat and the flesh
is firm and light grayish in color. The kidneys should be covered
with firm fat.

c. Place of veal in Army menu. g Two factors recommend veal as
an article of diet in the Army menu. These are: tenderness and
variety. Veal is a wholesome, nutritious meat, and being from a
young animal it is always tender. The delicate flavor of veal is
relished by many.

29. Cutting veal. g a. General.  ^The bone structure of veal is
identical with that of beef. (Compare the veal bone structure chart
(fig. 18) with the beef bone structure chart (fig. 3).) The names of
the wholesale market cuts and the way they are made in the packing-
house are very similar to lamb. Figure 17 shows the location of
the major cuts in a side of veal. Normally, the carcass is not split
but is sold as legs, loin, rib, and triangle, or a combination of these
cuts such as the saddle and rack.

h. Veal for Army use. g As a general rule, the entire veal carcass
may be utilized in much the same way as lamb ; namely, the triangle
for stew and the long saddle for roasts. The back section (shoulders,
rack, loin, and legs) also may be cut into chops and steaks. The actual
making of boneless veal cuts for Army use, however, will involve a
combination of beef, lamb, and pork cutting methods. The reason for
this is obvious when it is realized that a light veal weighs slightly
more than a heavy lamb. A heavy veal weighs about the same as a
medium-weight dressed hog and a little under one-half the weight of

a light carcass of beef. From this it can be seen that the weight of the
veal carcass will influence materially the cutting method to be followed.

&lt;?. Light veal. g ^Light veal carcasses weighing less than 100 pounds
may be cut into boneless roasts and boneless stew in practically the
same manner as recommended for lamb (par. 23). The roasts will be
somewhat larger in circumference than the comparable lamb roasts, but
they will not be too large to cook satisfactorily.

d. Heaney veal. g A heavy veal carcass, or heavy saddles and racks,
should be split down the center of the backbone, the same as beef.
The usual procedure is to saw through the tail bone and sacral verte-
brae, then use a cleaver to finish splitting the backbone. The fore-
quarter is usually separated from the hindquarter between the twelfth
and thirteenth ribs. There is no reason, however, why all 13 ribs should
not be left on the forequarter.

(1) Forequarters. g The method described for cutting the fore-
quarter of beef (par. 20c?) will be the most satisfactory method to
follow in boning heavy veal forequarters. This method will supply
the greatest number of solid pieces of meat for roasts, if a maximum
amount of roasting meat is desired. At the same time it is an easy way
to bone tlie forequarter when only meat for stewing is needed.

(2) Hindquarters. g The heavy veal hindquarter should be divided
into four major cuts: flank, market round (round with rump off but
T\’ith knuckle attached), hip (loin end and rump), and short loin.

The tenderloin should be removed before the hip and short loin are
separated.

(a) The flank will be used for stew, or for a dish other than a roast.

(&amp;) If the market round is a large one it should be divided into four
pieces (knuckle, inside, outside, and heel) as recommended for beef
( fig. 10) . If the round is of medium size it may be split into two bone-
less rolls as recommended for a heavy fresh ham (par. 25A;).

(c) The hip (rump and loin end) should be boned in one piece. The
i-esulting boneless veal butt will make an excellent roast.

(d) The loin strip should be removed from the backbone of the shell j

loin. (A short loin with the tenderloin out is a “shell” loin.) Some- *

times it is advisable to tie two loin strips together for roasting so that '

less meat will be exposed to the oven heat. This plan is comparable to |

the way a boneless pork loin is prepared for roasting ( par. 25g ) . The
same suggestion applies to the tenderloin.

30. Meat specialties. g a. General.  The name “meat specialties”
is given to those edible parts of beef, veal, pork, and lamb which can-
not be classed with the regular cuts. They are known also as '“extra" ■
edible parts,” “fancy meats,” “meat sundries,” “variety meats,” etc.

Use of these specialties is desirable because they introduce variety in
the menu. They are economical. In addition, they furnish the same
food elements found in muscle meats, and in some cases are extraordi-
nary sources of these nutrients, being rich in vitamin A and in the
vitamin B group. Because of their high moisture content and their
lack of fat, these organs do not keep well and should be kept in the
refrigerator until time to use them. There is little waste in these
meats, and being boneless, it is easy to figure the number of pounds
needed for one meal.

pears, but the posterior part known as “heart sweetbreads” is used.
Calf sweetbreads are more valuable commercially. Swine (pork) do
not have sweetbreads, while those of lamb are too small to have any
commercial value.

c. Brains . g Brains and sweetbreads are much alike in tenderness
and texture, and may be used in much the same way. An occasional
mess including brains is looked upon with favor by Army men.

d. Hearts. g Veal, lamb, and pork hearts are tenderer than those
from beef. They are also smaller. The heart is a muscular organ
and the meat is fibrous. Beef hearts contain a small piece of carti-
lage near the top center. This should be removed. Beef hearts
should be given long, slow cooking to make them tender.

e. Tongue . g Like hearts, the tongue receives considerable exercise
and, before it is cooked, is one of the least tender of meat specialties.
Veal and beef tongues are larger than those from pork or lamb.
Tongue is sold fresh, pickled, corned, or smoked.

/. Kidneys . g This variety meat is prized highly. Kidney stew espe-
cially has become famous. Kidneys should be of a dark red color,
firm texture, and free from strong odors. Pork, beef, veal, and lamb
kidneys are equally satisfactory for mess use. If kidneys have a
strong odor, this can l^e removed by slicing and soaking the meat in
salt water for several hours before cooking. While the kidneys
taken from a beef carcass are not sufficient in quantity by themselves
for a meal for the mess, they can be used to good advantage in lean
beef stew, potpie, or in soups and gravies.

g. Liver . g Liver is a very rich source of iron and other substances
concerned in the formation of red blood cells. It also is an excellent
source of vitamin A and the B complex. The flavor of liver is
enhanced by serving it with bacon. Pork and lamb liver should be
scalded before cooking; beef and veal liver need not be. Beef livers
should be full, short, thick, and tender, of a dark mahogany color,
have the gall bladder removed, and be free from bile stains.

h. Oxtails . g While they have considerable bone, oxtails also have a
goodly portion of meat and are very rich in flavor. Oxtails require
long, slow cooking in moist heat to make them tender and are used
for soup or prepared by braising. Before preparation, they should
be cut into pieces at each joint.

31. Frozen meats and fish. g a. In time of peace, beef , veal, lamb,
mutton, pork, poultry, and fish may be delivered to Army messes in
either a chilled or frozen condition. “Chilled” means that the meat
lias been held in a chill room until it reaches a temperature of 34°
to 36° F. “Frozen” means that meat has been held in a freezing

room, often called cold storage, at a temperature usually below zero
until solidly frozen to the center. In the continental United States,
meats, poultry, and fish normally are received by messes in a chilled
condition. In the Tropics they sometimes are frozen when received.
In time of war they may be received in frozen form both in the
Tropics and elsewhere.

h. Frozen meats and fish should never be thawed in water, as this
soaks out some of the meat juices, which reduces palatability and food
value.

e. While it is possible to thaw in ordinary room temperature, this is
bad practice and should be resorted to only when there is not time to
thaw in a refrigerator, because by the time the meat, poultry, or fish is
thawed to the center the outside may begin to spoil. This spoilage is
evidenced first by a slimy surface, and there may be a slight tainted
odor; these evidences of spoilage increase as time goes on, and
eventually the spoilage reaches such a stage that the surface must be
trimmed away. The best method of preventing surface spoilage while
thawing is to thaw at a temperature slightly above freezing (up to
40° F.). This requires longer time but is safe. Regardless of the
temperature of thawing, there should be a good circulation of air
around the frozen product being thawed. This is because moisture
appears on the surface while thawing, and moisture favors spoilage.
If the air around the thawing meat is kept moving it carries away
the moisture and the meat remains dry and in better condition.

d. If there is not sufficient room in the refrigerator to permit hang-
ing a quarter of frozen beef or a carcass of veal, it must be divided.
This is not particularly difficult. It can be done with a meat saw. It
is less difficult if thawing is allowed until cutting down to the bone
can be done with a knife, but this method is not recommended in a
warm room.

e. When using frozen meats, the time required for thawing must be
considered in planning cooking operations. For example, if roast
beef is to be served on Sunday, the frozen beef should be delivered
Thursday or early Friday morning. Following are approximate
times required for thawing in an Army mess refrigerator:


Hours

Frozen beef, quarters, chucks, or rounds 36-48

Frozen beef, loins, ribs 36-48

Frozen veal, mutton, or lamb carcasses 24-36

Frozen veal, mutton, or lamb cuts 18-30

Frozen pork, cuts 18-30

Frozen poultry or whole fish 12-24

/. Thin cuts of frozen meat, that is. cuts not more than 1 inch thick,
may be satisfactorily pan fried by putting the frozen cuts directly
into the hot pan without first thawing them. In pieces of this size
the frost is quickly driven out, and the interior becomes cooked before
the outside is overcooked. However, if the thin cuts are to be fried
in deep fat, they must first be thawed. If this is not done, the cold
in these cuts will cool the fat below the proper frying temperature.
About the only thin frozen cuts used in Army messes are frozen fish
fillets, and when cooked without being first thawed they are more
palatable.

g. When frozen meats are supplied to troops in the field as part of
the field ration, usually there will be no refrigerator in which to thaw
them. They must be thawed in the open, the rapidity of thawing de-
pending on weather conditions. In hot weather the surface of the
meat will begin to spoil before the meat is thawed at the center. This
spoilage may be retarded by hanging wet cloths or sacks around the
thawing meat. The wind blowing on these wet sacks will keep the
meat cooler than the surrounding atmosphere. Sometimes frozen meat
will be received in the field only a short time before it must be cooked
for the next meal. In such a case a stew may be made, using the
chuck, shanks, or round. The meat saw and cleaver must be used to
cut off these cuts. In hot weather cooked meats will keep longer
than chilled fresh meat, and when necessary to save meat to prevent
loss through spoilage, the cook should not hesitate to cook more meat
than is needed for immediate service.

A. Frozen Army boneless beef should be thawed in the boxes in
which it is packed. Because of the frost in the meat, the box becomes
the equivalent of a refrigerator and keeps all the meat refrigerated
while defrosting is taking place. The surface of the meat is not ex-
posed to the warm air of the room and surface deterioration (slime)
does not develop.

32. Sausage. g a. Commercial sausage is made from finely chopped
or ground meat (or meat products) to which cereal (as flour or corn
meal) may or may not have been added, and flavored with spices and
condiments. It usually is stuffed into a casing. Federal specifica-
tions do not permit the Army to purchase sausage to which cereal
has been added. The presence of any cereal must be declared on the
label, and when over 3 percent of cereal is present the product must
be labeled “Sausage and Cereal.” Sausage containing cereal should
not be accepted by Army messes.

A. Fresh pork sausage is made from fresh pork trimmings and should
never be eaten raw. It should be cooked until well done.

c. Cooked and smoked sausages, such as bologna, frankfurters, etc.,
are made from combinations of beef and pork trimmings and meat
products.

d. Dry sausage includes all summer sausages which are made from
pork and beef trimmings and for the most part are preserved by
drying. Some varieties of summer sausage are smoked. Dry sau-
sage containing lean pork, prepared in an official establishment, is
prepared in one of the ways prescribed by the Bureau of Animal
Industry to kill any trichinae that might be in the pork. No dry
sausage should be used unless it was prepared in an official
establishment.

33. Fish. g a. General.  Fish may be served broiled, fried, sauteed,
baked, or in salad. Fish are very perishable and for this reason
great care should be taken to avoid serving any which are not in
good condition. All fish should be carefully inspected when received
in the mess and again before being cooked or served, if kept very
long. Fish may be classed as fresh, stale, or putrid, as described
below. Only strictly fresh fish should be accepted or served by the
mess. Fresh fish, if not frozen, should be delivered to the mess
packed in cracked ice. For inspection and handling of frozen fish,
see paragraph 31.

(1) Fresh -fish. g Fresh fish have a bright appearance; the scales
are firmly adherent and glittering; the natural slime, if present, is
that common to the species ; the eyes are outstanding and full ; gills
and mouth closed; blood in abdomen bright with no off odor;
abdominal walls firm and elastic with no discoloration; flesh firm,
elastic, and tight on the bones; when placed horizontally across the
hand the fish does not bend ; when placed in water it sinks.

(2) StaJs -fish. g Stale fish have a duller appearance than fresh;
scales are more or less easily removable and slightly slimy or smeary
or may be abnormally dry; eyes red bordered; surface of eyeball
cloudy; gills pale yellow, dirty or grayish red, and covered with
slime of disagreeable odor; blood in abdomen dull in color and may
have slight off odor; abdominal walls becoming soft and flabby;
body bony and bends easily especially at the tail end; finger impres-
sions easily made and remain ; meat somewhat soft and more easily
discolored. When placed in water a stale fish floats.

(3) Putrid fsh. g All the brightness gone; dull, lifeless color; scales
very loose and covered with a smeary, slimelike mass of very dis-
agreeable odor; eyes breaking down or gone; all bright color gone
from the gills which have an extremely offensive odor ; body withered
and flabby; abdominal walls soft and pulpy with apple- jelly-like

appearance and discolored ; meat soft ; abdomen bloated ; body blood
dirty brown in color and with offensive odor. A putrid fish floats
when placed in water.

h. To deem fish. g (1) Scaling .  ^The scales are removed with a
knife held at such an angle that the blade will work under the scales
as the knife is pushed in the direction of the head from the tail, with
short, quick motions.

(2) Removing entraUs . g ^With a pointed knife cut the entire
length of the belly from the vent to the head, taking care not to cut
the entrails. Cut the head from the body, starting from the belly
side. The entrails can then be removed by hand. In some small
fish it is possible to remove the entrails with the head by opening
the belly, then loosening the head by cutting from the back, and
pulling in the direction of the vent. After the entrails have been
removed the fish should be wiped thoroughly, inside and out, with a
cloth wrung out of cold water. There may be some clotted blood
near the backbone that cannot be removed in any other way tihan
by wiping.

(3) Shinning . g Eels and bullheads do not have scales and are usu-
ally skinned. The fins along the back should first be removed with a
sharp knife or scissors. Make a cut, skin deep, along the entire back;
grasp the skin on the back, just back of the head, between the thumb
and a knife blade and pull downward and backward. The skin will
usually come off in a sheet. If the flesh is tender, care should be
taken not to tear it by pulling too quickly. In skinning bullheads
it may be necessary to fasten the fish by the head by hanging it on
a hook or by driving a nail through the head, because the skin is
tight to the flesh and it takes hard pulling to remove it. It may
be necessary to use a pair of pliers for this purpose.

(4) Boning. g Haddock, cod, halibut, whitefish, etc., are quite
easily boned. After the fish are scaled (or skinned) and cleaned, run a
sharp knife along each side of the backbone from the tail to the head
and pull back the flesh from the backbone. Any small bones that
cannot be removed readily with the backbone may be pulled out by
the fingers. Another method of boning is to dress the fish and re-
move the head, then grasp the backbone at the head end with one
hand and pull the flesh away from the backbone with the other.
Pull out all loose bones that have not been removed with the back-
bone, and/or scrape over the flat surface of the inside of the fish
with a knife.

34. Poultry. g a. General .  Poultry includes those birds which are
usually raised on farms for their flesh and eggs. The principal

classes of poultry are chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese. Turkey is
included in the ration for Thanksgiving Day and for Christmas, but
chicken is the class of poultry most used in the mess. Ducks and
geese are seldom used in Army messes. Ducks yield a smaller
amount of food than any other class of poultry and are usually high
in price. Geese are usually less expensive and yield a good propor-
tion of edible meat, but are not so popular because of their sup-
posed greasiness. When cooked properly, roast goose is very tasty
and a desirable change from the other classes of poultry. Ducks
and geese have no white meat such as is found on the breasts of
turkeys and chickens. Chicken is the only class of poultry which
is commonly served to the mess fried or fricasseed.

h. Chickens^ kinds and uses . g There are four principal classes of
chickens: broilers, fryers, roasters, and fowl. Broilers and fryers
are young birds with tender flesh and are best suited for broiling or
frying. They are too small to roast satisfactorily and have too little
fat on them to be used for stew or fricassee. Fresh broilers can be
found on the market during June and July, and fresh fryers during
July, August, and September of each year. At all other seasons
fresh broilers and fryers are both scarce and expensive, but they
may be procured from cold storage during this time, if desired.
Fowl and roasters best meet the needs of the Army mess. Fowl,
which are fat hens over 1 year of age, are usually somewhat tough
and therefore used for stew and fricassee. The best grades of hens
are sold as fowl and usually are kept in cold storage; stewing hens
are the poorer grade. They can be bought fresh at any time of the
year. Roasting chickens are quick-grown young cockerels. Their
meat is tender, and they are excellent for roasting. Fresh roasters
are found on the market from September to January; at other
times frozen roasters may be procured. Cocks (old roosters) and
stags (male birds with marked masculine characteristics) should
never be used by Army messes. Age is determined by the size and
development of the birds, the condition of the shanks, claws, and
spurs, and the condition of the cartilage of the breastbone. Young
birds are lankier and rangier than mature (old) birds, and the head,
wattles, and comb are undeveloped. The shanks (lower leg) of
young birds are smooth and bright, while with increasing age the
shanks become roughened, scaly, and dull colored. On broilers the
spur is scarely noticeable; on fryers it shows as a small rounded
knob ; on roasters the spur is more prominent, but not hard ; on stags
the spur becomes longer and harder. The claws of young birds are
short, slender, and pointed, while on old birds they become long,

dull, and stubby. The cartilage at the rear (lower) edge of the
breastbone is soft and pliable in young birds while as the bird grows
older this cartilage gradually turns to bone and becomes firm and
rigid. Cockerels and cocks have a greater development and usually
deeper color of wattles and comb and larger heads than pullets and
hens. Hens have a deeper, broader body, especially in the abdomen,
than cocks. The shanks and thighs of hens are much slenderer
than those of the male birds, and the spurs of the hen are small
and undeveloped. The neck, back, and tail feathers of the cock
are usually much heavier than those of the hen. A cook should
be able to recognize readily the different classes of birds in order that
he may determine which is the best manner of cooking and serving
them.

c. Turkeys^ kinds and uses . g ^Army specifications prescribe only
young turkeys for use in the mess. Here again age is reflected in the
size of the bird, condition of the breastbone, size of the dewbill and
beard, size of the spurs, and color of the legs. Young toms are more
rangy and leggy than hens. Hens have short, plump bodies ; small,
short legs and wings; small heads with small dewbills (the fleshy
growth just above the beak) , and either a small beard or none at all.
Old toms have a long, coarse beard, prominent dewbill, and large,
heavy spurs. The beard begins to grow on the breast of the male
turkey at the age of 2*4 months, and at 1 year old is from 3 to 5 inches
long, becoming longer each year. When about a year old, the turkey
hen begins to grow a beard, but it is always short compared with that
of the tom. The dewbill is always larger and more elastic in the male
(tom) than the female bird. Young toms have only a short, blunt
knob on the inside of the shank, while old toms develop a stout spur.
The hen turkey has only a small rudimentary spur or button. Tur-
keys’ feet are said to be black up to 1 year of age, assume a pinkish
color up to 3 years, and then gradually turn a dull gray. The
breastbone cartilage of the young turkey is always soft and pliable,
gradually becoming hard and firm as age advances.

d. To draxo and clean 'poultry. g (1) The poultry received by the
Army mess usually has been killed and bled, then dressed and chilled
or frozen. Dressed means that the feathers have been removed, but
dressed poultry practically never has been drawn (entrails removed) ;
therefore, if the mess receives dressed poultry it is necessary to re-
move the entrails after receipt. If the entrails have been removed
before being received by the mess, the poultry is called dressed and
drawn. Before drawing a bird the skin should be cleaned. The fine
hair found here and there on the skin can be easily removed by

singeing. This is done by holding the bird for a moment over a gas
flame, or any other clean flame, and turning it so that all portions of the
skin come in contact with the flame. Pin feathers are removed by
grasping them between the thumb and the blade of a paring knife
and pulling ihenr out. Next step (except in the case of turkeys) is
to cut off the head with a cleaver or a heavy butcher knife and
to remove the feet by cutting through the hock joint with a knife.
All of the tough, coarse skin on the hocks should be trimmed off. The
legs of turkeys contain a number of coarse tendons that are
objectionable if not removed. To do this, loosen the skin and the
ligaments on each side of the hock joint, and then twist the foot until
it is free except for the tendons. Then by hanging the bird up by
the feet and pulling straight downward, these tendons will pull out
of the leg muscles and remain attached to the feet (shank). The
first step in drawing a bird is to remove the crop, gullet, and wind-
pipe. Slit the skin covering the crop crosswise with a knife, and
loosen the crop all around with the fingers. Then cut the gullet be-
low the crop and close to the breastbone, and remove the crop and
neck part of the gullet by pulling. By thus removing these parts
first, the entrails remaining can be drawn out more easily. The
windpipe may have to be cut near the lungs to remove it readily, and
should be pulled out at this time.

(2) Next cut from the rear of the breastbone to the vent (anus)
and loosen the vent by cutting around it. Insert the hand into this
opening, grasp the intestines as far forward as possible, and draw
them out to the rear. All except the lungs should come out together.
The giblets (heart, liver, and gizzard) should now be separated from
the entrails and the remainder discarded. There is usually consider-
able fat attached to the intestines of geese which should be removed
and used for cooking or rendering. The blood vessels should be cut
away from the top of the heart. The gall bladder is attached to the
liver and should be carefully removed to avoid puncturing. No bile
should be allowed to come in contact with the meat, as this may impart
a very bitter flavor which is hard to remove. The inlet (gullet)
and outlet (intestine) of the gizzard should be cut as close to the giz-
zard as possible, and the gizzard opened by cutting through one side
down as far as the sac which lines the gizzard. This sac may be
entirely removed with the fingers if a little care is used and the sac
itself is not cut. The gizzards of geese have two disks of cartilage
on their inner surface, which generally should be removed by a knife.
The lungs are easily removed. They are soft and pulpy and lie in
the forward end of the cavity underneath the ribs and on either side

of the backbone. They have no food value and should be removed.
The kidneys lie on either side of the backbone toward the rear of
the cavity. They are not easily removed entirely, and may be left in,
as they have some food value, and are palatable and edible. The oil
gland (bag) just above the tail should be removed with a knife, care
being taken to remove all of the gland. It can be distinguished from
the surrounding tissue by its darker color. The drawn and dressed
carcass is then ready for washing. It should be rinsed under a faucet,
allowing the cold water to run through it and over it, washing off any
stains or foreign matter. The carcass should never be soaked in
water. If the bird is to be roasted, it is now ready to be stuffed.
After stuffing, the cuts made for removing the entrails are sewed up
and the bird is ready for the oven. If the bird is to be used for any
other purpose than for roasting, it must be cut up. The wings, legs,
and thighs are unjointed with a knife, and the remainder of the
carcass cut into as many pieces as desired with either a knife or cleaver.

35. Dairy pr9ducts. g a. Milk.  (1) Fresh milk and hutter-
milk . g Fresh whole milk should be served in the mess daily. Great
care is exercised to insure that only wholesome milk is delivered to
the mess. This same care must be exercised by the mess personnel
after it is received at the mess. The milk is pasteurized to destroy
disease micro-organisms. Fresh milk is an excellent medium for
the growth of bacteria and is easily contaminated. Milk should
never be delivered to the mess in bulk as continued dipping and
mixing of air in the milk again introduces disease organisms. For
this reason, milk should be delivered in half-pint bottles and issued
to the soldier in the same bottle as received. Fresh pasteurized
milk should be used in every mess whenever available, especially for
breakfast, as the men prefer it for their cereal or for drinking.
Buttermilk should be handled in the same manner as described above
for fresh milk.

(2) Evaporated . g Evaporated milk is milk that was reduced to
less than one-half of its original volume by the evaporation of water.
It is usually issued to the mess in 14i/^ -ounce cans which is sufficient
to make 1 quart of whole milk by the addition of water. It may
be used as it comes from the can, the same as cream. When diluted,
it may be used the same as fresh milk. Evaporated milk keeps well
if not exposed to high temperatures. It should be stored in a cool
place and turned often to keep the cream from separating.

(3) Dry . g (a) There are two principal forms of dry milk. One is
the dry milk containing all the butterfat and is known as “dry whole
milk.” The other is the product from which has been removed all

35


fat which it is possible to remove. This product is sold as “dry
milk solids not over 1^ percent fat,” “dried skimmed milk,” “skim
milk powder,” or “powdered skim milk.” The dry whole milk is
flesh, sweet whole milk, from which the water has been removed.
It is a cream-colored powder, containing 26 to 27 percent butterfat.
“Dry milk solids not over I 1/2 percent fat” is fresh, sweet milk from
which both fat and water have been removed.

(b) Because of the fat content, dry whole milk is subject to devel-
opment of rancidity. When pkcked in vacuum or an inert gas, the
oxidation of the butterfat is retarded and it may be stored for
several months. Since the fat content of dry milk solids (skim
milk) is very low, the milk does not easily deteriorate and can be
kept for at least 6 months under ordinary conditions. Because dried
milk readily absorbs moisture it should be kept in an airtight recep-
tacle. If dry milk should become lumpy, the lumps should be broken
with a rolling pin and sifted through a sieve.

(c) Dry milk may be used in dry form in almost any food. Re-
mixing with water is not necessary unless it is used as a beverage
or other dish containing a great deal of liquid. If it is desired to
reconstitute dry milk, the best procedure is to place the necessary
quantity of dry product on top of the water and stir until dissolved.
Lukewarm water is usually best for this purpose g never hot water.
Another method is to add a small quantity of water to the dry
milk product, mix to a paste consistency, and then add the remainder
of the water slowly.

5. Butter. g Butter, containing not less than 80 percent butterfat,
has a high calorific value. Aside from its high calorific value it is
one of the chief sources of vitamin A in the ordinary diet. Butter
absorbs fiavors and odors very readily and should not be stored with
other foods unless well protected against the absorption of food
flavors. It should be handled the same as fresh milk and kept in
the refrigerator until time of serving.

c. Cheese . g There are two types of cheese on the market, the natural
cheese and the processed or pasteurized cheese. The natural cheese
is made from either raw or pasteurized milk which has been inocu-
lated with a specific bacteria and seasoned to give it its characteristic
flavor. Processed cheese is the natural cheese pasteurized and sold
as “Processed Cheddar,” “Processed Swiss,” etc. The consumption
of the two types is about equal. The processed cheese has a milder
flavor than the natural cheese. It is usually packed in brick shapes
of various weights and wrapped with specially treated paper. Both
types of cheese have the same nutritive value. Cheese is high in

THE ARMY COOK


proteins and fat and should be served often in the mess as a sub-
stitute for meat. One or two varieties should always be included
in cold suppers on Sundays or holidays. Processed cheese is usually
higher priced than the natural cheese. However, there is no waste
of rind to processed cheese and it is much easier to cut into econom-
ical servings. Considering these facts it may be as cheap to serve
processed cheese as natural cheese.

d. Ice cream, ices, and sherbets . g Ice cream is a very satisfactory
dessert, either summer or winter. Ices should not be confused with
ice cream as they are usually made from water, fruit juices, and sugar.
Sherbets are similar to ices but contain some egg white. Both ices
and sherbets make a satisfactory dessert after a heavy meal, especially
on a hot summer’s day. Ice cream can be purchased from commercial
concerns at reasonable prices and conveniently wrapped for individ-
ual servings, usually six or seven servings to the quart. If the equip-
ment is available, ice cream, ices, and sherbets can be made in the mess
at a considerable saving.

36. Eggs. g a. General.  (1) The term “eggs” unqualified, means
hens’ eggs. Hens’ eggs average, when fresh, approximately 2 ounces
each, of which weight the yolk represents 32 percent, the white 57
percent, and the shell 11 percent. The food value or flavor of the
egg is in no way influenced by the color of the shell. The general
color of the yolk varies with the feed. Green feed and yellow corn
produce dark-colored yolks, while small grain and white corn produce
light -colored yolks. The albumen (egg white) is held together by a
very fine network of fibrous material radiating through it from the
shell membranes. It is this network that enmeshes and holds the air
when an egg is whipped. With age these fibers become weaker and
do not retain the air so well. Consequently, an old egg does not whip
satisfactorily.

(2) The most common deterioration of eggs, especially in warm
weather, is due to germination. Fertile eggs will germinate at any
normal temperature above 68° F. Fresh eggs, therefore, should be
held at temperatures below 68° F. As eggs absorb odors, egg storage
rooms must be kept sweet, clean, and free from foreign odors.

(3) If the egg whites are to be whipped, none of the yolk should
be allowed to get into the dish as it keeps the whites from becoming
fluffy. If many eggs are to be broken into a dish, they should be
broken and dropped into a saucer, one by one, so that any bad eggs
may be thrown out without spoiling the whole batch.

h. Dried eggs . g (1) There are three classes of dried egg products:
dried whole egg, dried yolk, and dried albumen (whites).

(2) A good dried egg made from strictly fresh 'whole eggs has ex-
cellent keeping qualities, flavor, and aroma. It does not require re-
frigeration and can be stored at ordinary temperatures for several
months. It is a product that will lend itself to field conditions where
it is diflScult to issue fresh eggs or where refrigeration is lacking. It
is also adaptable to cold climates as freezing will not injure the
product.

(3) It is not necessary to reconstitute the powdered egg for baking.
The best method is to add it dry and incorporate it by creaming with
the shortening in the formula. (See par. 6, app.)

37. Canned foods. g a. General.  Canned foods are fresh foods
preserved by heating them in hermetically sealed containers. Canned
foods are subjected to thorough heat treatments, which destroy the
bacteria and other organisms that may cause spoilage at ordinary tem-
peratures. There is a common impression that consumers of canned
food are liable to ptomaine poisoning. Sterilized food in airtight
containers cannot, under any circumstances, be dangerous.

h. Nutritive value. g Most of the nutritive value of the food is pre-
served with the product. In many cases the nutritive value will be
higher than in the overcooked fresh vegetables. Much of the nutri-
tive value of the food is dissolved in the liquid surrounding the prod-
uct. For this reason the juices should be served with the food or
used for sauces, soups, stock, or gravy. Canned sea foods are rich
in iodine and vitamins A and D.

c. Preparation of canned foods . g Canned fruits and vegetables, as
well as other kinds of canned food, have been thoroughly cooked in
the canning process and require no cooking in the mess. If it is de-
sired to serve canned foods hot, it is only necessary to heat them for a
few minutes before serving. Canned foods should never be boiled or
heated longer than necessary. Boiling or prolonged heating tends to
destroy many of the vitamins. Most of the canned meat products on
the market can be served without cooking. However, some of the pork
products are only partially cooked and require additional cooking or
roasting before being served.

d. Inspection of canned foods. g The containers of all canned goods
should be inspected when issued to the mess. Swells (cans with bulged
ends), leakers (containers from which juice has escaped), and badly
rusted cans should be rejected. Slight rusting, dented, or soiled labels
do not affect the quality of the food and are no cause for rejection.

e. Storage of canned foods. g ^The keeping quality of canned food
depends, to a large extent, upon the nature of the product. The
acid of certain fruits and vegetables reacts with the metal of the can.

causing pinholes. 'Many highly colored products fade and others
disintegrate with time. The following points should be considered
whene storing canned goods :

(1) Dry storage with good ventilation.

(2) Cool storage. The ideal would be approximately 50° F.

(3) Avoid freezing temperatures. Frozen canned food is seldom
ruined if the cans are not injured. However, there is some break-
down of the cell tissue and the product will not have as good an
appearance as before freezing. If canned goods should freeze, do not
defrost until you are ready to use them. Frozen canned foods should
be thawed slowly.

(4) Canned fruits and vegetables of the acid type (cherries, ber-
ries, pineapples, plums, sauerkraut, etc.) spoil rather rapidly in warm
temperatures and should not be kept on hand in the mess for more
than 3 months. Canned fi’uits and vegetables of the nonacid type
(apricots, peaches, pears, beans, corn, peas, pumpkin, etc.) keep well
and may be stored under proper conditions for 6 months to 1 year.
Canned meats are good keepers and may be stored for 1 year. Some
canned pork products which have not been thoroughly cooked must
be stored under refrigeration. Canned sea foods do not keep as well
as canned meats and should receive frequent inspection. Canned milk
should not be stored over 6 months and the cases should be turned
frequently to prevent separation' of the butterfat from the milk.

38. Cereals, breakfast. g a. There are three main types of break-
fast cereals on the market :

(1) Uncooked g corn meal, farina, cracked whole wheat, etc.

(2) Quick cooking g cereals that have been partially cooked before
packing and require but 3 to 5 minutes for preparation.

(3) lieady-to-eat g cereals which can be served without further
preparation. Keady-to-eat cereals are of various types : flaked, puffed,
malted, and shredded.

h. The uncooked and the quick cooking cereals are the lowest in
cost and those made from whole grains give the greatest food value.
They are of especial value in the mess on cold days or at times when
considerable time elapses between the morning meal and noon meal,
as this type of cereal seems to stave off hunger for a longer period.

c. The ready-to-eat cereals have their advantage in that they can
be served without preparation by the cook. There is a wide variety
on the market, most of which are packed in individual packages.
The individual package is the most satisfactory unit for use in Army
messes. A variety can be placed on the table and the soldier can

choose the cereal he prefers. There are no open packages left to
protect against dust and insects or left-overs to worry about.

d. Both uncooked and ready-to-eat cereals should be used to give
variety to the menu. During hot weather the soldier may prefer the
ready-to-eat cereals. However, many prefer the uncooked cereals
when fresh milk is not available.

39. Beverages. g a. Coffee .  Coffee is the most important bever-
age served in the Army. The coffee furnished to Army messes is of
good quality and will make an excellent beverage, provided it has
not lost its strength and the beverage is properly made. Coffee loses
its strength rapidly after roasting and the loss of strength is has-
tened if the roasted coffee is ground. Loss of strength is retarded if
roasted and ground coffee is kept in tightly closed containers. When
practicable, coffee should be ground just before using in order to get
the maximum strength from it. When roasted and ground coffee is
purchased by the mess it should be purchased in amounts that can be
used in 2 to 3 days. When making coffee, grounds once used should
be discarded. A good cup of coffee cannot be made when fresh coffee
is added to grounds already used. Coffee should never be boiled and
the coffee utensils should be cleaned immediately after use.

h. Tea . g ^There are three general classes of tea: green (unfer-
mented), black (fermented), and oolong (semifermented). Black
tea is usually furnished for Army messes and is an excellent bever-
age if properly prepared. Pour freshly boiling water on the required
amount of leaves in an earthen pot. Allow it to brew for 3 to 5
minutes, then remove the tea leaves and serve. Iced tea should be
made in the same manner, except doubly strong and poured over
cracked ice. The ice will melt and dilute the tea to its regular
strength. If the hot tea is permitted to cool before the ice iff added
it will have a cloudy appearance. Tea will absorb moisture and
odors, and the volatile oil will evaporate. Store tea in tightly
covered cans and in a cool place.

c. Cocoa . g Cocoa is the ground cacao bean from which part of
the fat has been extracted. “Breakfast Cocoa” must contain not
less than 22 percent cacao fat and therefore is a more nutritious
beverage than the product “Cocoa.” Cocoa is an excellent medium
by which to introduce milk into the diet. Cocoa is rich in starch,
therefore cocoa boiled for 5 minutes has a much better flavor than that
which is made by simply adding it to scalded milk.

40. Condiments. g a. A good cook depends on condiments to give
flavor and relish to food. To obtain the desired results, spices are

added sparingly to give a hidden flavor and never in such amounts
as to destroy the flavor of the food.

h. Spices are aromatic seeds, buds, bark, roots, and leaves of various
plants used to season food. They may be used in ground form and
mixed with the food or they may be used whole and withdrawn
before servipg the food. Whole spices are usually used in the prep-
aration of soups, sauces, and pot roasts.

c. Salt should be added to the food when prepared for cooking.
Vegetables should be cooked in salted water. The cook must be care-
ful when adding salt as a little excess salt will ruin the product.
Salt can be added to the food after it is prepared, but once added,
it cannot be removed.

41. Com meal and grits. g Com meal is groimd white or yellow
corn with the hull removed and the fine corn flour sifted out. About
the only difference between hominy grits and corn meal is that the
com meal is of a finer grind. Both can be cooked and served as a
breakfast cereal or as a fried mush. The corn meal is used for com
muflins and corn bread. The grits are often used as a substitute for
potatoes and served with gravy.

42. Extracts, flavoring. g Flavoring extracts are derived from
two sources: plants, known as “true extracts,” and chemical com-

• pounds that produce the desired flavor and aroma for which the extract
is named. Such flavors are called “synthetic” or “imitation” flavors.
The true extracts have a more delicate flavor and aroma than the
synthetic flavors. Most Army messes use only vanilla and lemon
flavors. There are many more on the market and much interest can
be added to the food by using a variety of flavors.

43. Fruits and vegetables. g a. Fresh .  (1) Fruits.  Fresh
fraits should be served daily in organization messes. Advantage
should be taken of fruits that are in season for they are of the best
quality and lowest price. With the present cold storage facilities,
citrus fruits are in season the entire year. They are of especial value
for their vitamin content and should be included in the menu at
frequent intervals. The vitamin content of fruit is utilized to best
advantage when served raw, however, a variety of desserts can be
made by the cooking of fresh fruits. This may be especially desirable
when green apples are on the market for use in pie, cobbler, and
sauces. Underripe or green fruits have a high starch content and
should be cooked to make them digestible.

(2) Vegetables . g Fresh vegetables are best in appearance and flavor
and richest in vitamin value when freshly gathered. Much of the
vitamin value is lost through storage and handling, due to oxidation.

More vitamins and minerals are lost through overcooking or cooking
in a large amount of water. Some of the vitamins are destroyed by
heat or dissolved in water. It is obvious, therefore, that the maximum
nutritive value will be retained by the avoidance of overcooking,
soaking too long in water, and the use of small quantities of cooking
water. The water in which the vegetables are cooked contains water-
soluble vitamins and minerals and should be used for soups, gravies,
and sauces. As many of the vitamins and minerals are lost through
cooking, fresh vegetables should be served raw as salads when it is
safe to do so. Raw carrots can be combined with raisins. Coleslaw
combined with apples and a little raw onion makes a good salad rich
in protective foods. However, salads should be prepared just before
serving to preserve their freshness and nutritive value. Many such
varities can be made by the cook, through planning and the exercise of
ingenuity.

h. Dried. g (1) General .  ^There are several terms used to designate
dried fruits and vegetables: dehydrated, evaporated, sun-dried, and
dried. These terms refer to the methods used for drying. “Dried”
refers to all dried food regardless of the means used for extracting
the moisture. Considerable progress has been made in the dehydra-
tion of fruits and when properly prepared they will make a very tasty
dish. There are two classes of dehydrated fruits and vegetables on
the market. The flake and powder form does not rehydrate to its
original form and is used for jellies, desserts, bakery products, ice
cream, ices, and sherbets. The other form is the fruit or vegetable
dehydrated in the original form or in pieces, and when rehydrated,
can be used the same as fresh fruits or vegetables.

(2) Fruits . g During an emergency it may be necessary to use dried
fruits to conserve storage and transportation space. Much of the
vitamin and mineral content is lost during the dehydration process
but those fruits are otherwise of the same nutritional value as canned
fruits. Dried fruits, such as raisins, prunes, and apricots, are sub-
ject to insect infestation and should be kept in well- ventilated storage
not over 50° F. Others are dried to a very low moisture content and
do not require as low a storage temperature. These products take up
moisture from the air very rapidly and should be stored in a dry
place and kept well covered at all times.

(3) V egetables . g The terms used for dried fruits apply also for
dried vegetables. The powder and .flake are used for seasoning and
soups. The whole or diced and sliced types are used for vegetable
dishes in the same manner as fresh vegetables. Many of these prod-

ucts require but a few minutes for preparation as compared to hours
with the old type of dried vegetable.

(a) Beam . g ^There are a number of types of dry beans that may
be purchased for mess uses. Each type has a number of different
varieties with the exception of the black-eye bean, which is also known
as the “cowpea” or “black-eye pea.” The Great Northern navy bean
may be issued at one time and a small pea bean the next. The two
are different varieties of the navy bean. The kidney bean may be
red or dark red ; the lima bean may be large or baby lima bean. The
eating qualities of the various varieties are the same, but the cooking
qualities differ. For this reason the issue should be of one variety.
These dry beans should be soaked for several hours before cooking.
If large navy beans are mixed with small pea beans, the small bean
will be overcooked and mush before the large bean is properly cooked.
The white beans are preferred for baking while colored beans, lima
beans, or black-eye beans are usually simmered.

(d) Rice . g ^Polished rice is usually supplied the Army mess. Un-
polished or “brown rice” has a high vitamin content, especially B 1
complex, and should be used where the soldier will eat it. It has
a different flavor from polished rice and should be tried in the mess
before a large quantity is ordered.

44. Jams, jellies, preserves, and fruit butters. g a. Jam is
made from whole small fruits which are either mashed or cooked to
a pulp with sugar. Good jam is soft, tender, and jellylike in texture,
bright and sparkling in color, and of the same consistency throughout
the mixture.

h. Jelly is made from the juice of the fruit combined with sugar.

A good jelly is clear, bright, and tender. When cut, it has a clean
surface and does not stick to the knife or spoon. When turned from
the glass, jelly should hold its shape and should quiver but not
break.

c. Preserves are whole fruits or pieces of fruit preserved in a heavy
sugar sirup. A good preserved fruit is plump, tender, and bright
in color.

d. Fruit butters consist of the whole fruit cooked until tender and
then rubbed through a sieve to remove the seeds and skin. The
pulp is added to sugar and spices and cooked until smooth and
thick.

45. Lard and lard substitute. g a. Lard is rendered hog fat.
Lard substitutes are made from animal and vegetable fats or from
vegetable fats alone. Lard and lard substitutes containing animal
fats are usually very near the same price. The nutritive value of

these fats is approximately the same in cooking and in the diet. Con-
siderable improvements have been made in lard, giving it a high
breaking point (point where it will smoke), making it more desirable
for deep fat frying. Lard is also preferred for pies and biscuits.

6. Excess fat cut from fresh beef and pork should be rendered
and used for frying. Drippings from roasts and bacon should also
be saved and used for frying and making gravies.

46. Macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti. g These products are
known as alimentary pastes. The different forms and sizes of these
pastes, are merely a matter of different molds in the machinery and
cutting to desired size. Noodles are made from the same kind of
paste as macaroni and spaghetti except that eggs are sometimes
included and are thus known as egg noodles.

47. Dressings, salad. g a. Mayonnaise dressing is made of edible
oil? yolk, lemon juice or vinegar, and seasoning (salt, pepper,
etc.). Mayonnaise may be made in the kitchen at a considerable
saving. A variety of dressings can be made using mayonnaise as a
base. Russian dressing can be made by adding lemon juice, chili
sauce, and Worcestershire sauce to taste. Tartare sauce can be made
by adding chopped green olives and pickles to mayonnaise.

h. Salad dressing might be thought of as a diluted mayonnaise. It
is made of oil, egg yolk, lemon juice or vinegar, and cornstarch
as a filler. A good salad dressing should contain at least 35 percent
oil. However, many brands are on the market with as low as 9
percent oil. For this reason there is a great variation in price. The
same variety of dressings may be made as with mayonnaise using salad
dressing as a base.

c. French dressing is a mixture of oil, lemon juice or vinegar, salt,
mustard, and other spices, if desired. The oil will separate from
the liquid and spices and care should be taken to see that the ingredi-
ents are well mixed before using. French dressings are now on the
market containing a carrier that prevents separation.

d. The common salad oils used are refined cottonseed and corn oil.
Olive oil is also used but is usually too expensive for use in the mess.
Soya bean oil is used to some extent but does not have the keeping
qualities of the other oils. Any of these oils may be used for making
the various dressings in the troop mess.

48. Sirup. g ^There are many kinds of sirup. They differ in body
and flavor. A sugar sirup may be made by boiling 1 pound of white
sugar, 1 pound of brown sugar, and 1 pint of water. This may be
flavored with maple or vanilla extract. Pure maple sirup is usually
too expensive for mess use. A maple-flavored sirup is a good sub-

stitute. Molasses wliich is a good source of iron and calcium is
used for both table and cooking,

49. Sugar. g a. Sugar is made from beets or sugarcane. There is
no dilference between cane and beet sugar. The term “granulated”
simply means that the sugar is in crystals of a certain size. The
Army uses the size “fine granulated” or “medium fine granulated.”
Powdered sugar is beet or cane sugar, ground to a powder. The
powdered sugar for icing contains a small percentage of starch to
give the icing a smooth appearance.

h. Brown sugar has not been completely refined and contains a
small amount of molasses. Therefore its mineral content is higher i
than that of refined sugar g this gives brown sugar its distinctive
flavor. It is used where its flavor and color are desired as in some
types of cookies, cakes, and puddings. If brown sugar is kept in
a moist place or in a tight jar it will not cake, but if kept in a dry
place it will cake.

50. Tapioca. g Tapioca is a starch manufactured from the cassava
root. It is made in the following forms: small pearl, medium pearl,
flake, and granulated. All of these have the power of swelling and
becoming jellylike when cooked. Pearl tapioca is used chiefly for
puddings ; the flake and granulated forms are valuable as binders for |
juicy pies.

51. Cooking, general. g a. When cooking was first discovered, the
primary object was to make food more appetizing than when in the
raw state. Proper cooking, in addition to making food more appetiz-
ing and easier to chew, makes some foods more digestible, and also

destroys any disease germs or parasites which may be present in the
food. It is now known that cooking must take into consideration the
possibilities of the loss of nutritive value, particularly the vitamins
and minerals, if the soldier is to be well fed.

h. Skillful cooking is an art, acquired by experience and training.
The experienced and skillful cook does more than apply heat to food g
he knows how to combine and blend foods so that appetizing flavors
are developed ; how to season for the same result ; and how to get the
most out of the food supplies on hand.

c. Although it requires experience and training to become an expert
cook, anyone, after having learned the fundamentals of cooking, can
cook a satisfactory and appetizing meal by following the recipes given
in chapter 2. These fundamentals of cooking are simple but all-
important. Two of them which should be carefully observed are use
of the proper temperatures and proper cooking times for different
foods. All foods cannot be cooked at the same temperature and for
the same length of time. Meats require long cooking at moderate
temperatures ; green vegetables should be given a short cooking; pastry
is baked for a. short time at comparatively high temperature. From
the foregoing it will be seen how important it is to learn the funda-
mentals of cooking before starting to cook.

d. The term “cooking” is often used to mean the preparation of food
for cooking as well as the actual cooking. This preparation may be
merely peeling, as in the case of onions, potatoes, etc., or it may include
cutting, slicing, grinding, chopping, etc. While preparation changes
the form of food, the actual cooking may not only change the form
but may also change the flavor or chemical composition, thus rendering
the food more appetizing and digestible. An example of this is the
cooking of potatoes and other starchy foods. Starch, when raw, is
difficult to digest; when changed by cooking it is easy to digest. On
the other hand, improper cooking decreases palatability and results
in waste, loss of nutritive value, and may mean an inadequately fed
soldier.

52. Methods of cooking and terms defined. g a. Methods.
Baking . g Cooking by dry heat, usually in an oven.

Boiling . g Cooking in water at a temperature of 212° F. Slowly boil-
ing water has the same temperature as rapidly boiling water, con-
sequently is able to do the same work g a fact often forgotten by
the cook, who is apt to wood the fire that water may boil vigorously.
Braising . g ^To brown in a hot receptacle in a small amount of fat,
then cook slowly in a small amount of liquid, covered.

BroUvng . g Cooking by direct heat from hot coals, a gas flame, or an
electric element.

Deep- fat frying. g Cooking in hot fat at a temperature of from 350°
to 400° F., depending on the nature of the food to be cooked.

Fricasseeing. g A combination of sauteing with stewing. Tlie food to
be fricasseed is first sauteed, then stewed.

Frying. g Cooking in just enough fat to keep the food from sticking.

Oven hroiling. g Cooking in a broiler pan that runs close under the
heat in the broiling oven of a gas or electric stove.

Pan hroiling. g Cooking in a hot griddle or pan greased only enough
to prevent food from sticking.

. Presftvre cooking. g Cooking in steam at a pressure of 5 to 30 pounds
and at temperatures 228° to 274° F. The rise in the temperature
of the steam is caused by holding it under pressure. A special
cooker is necessary for this cooking.

R ousting. g As now used, this means the same as baking. The term is
usually applied to meat cookery.

Sauteing. g Cooking in a small quantity of fat. The article to be
cooked must be shifted from side to side and turned to come in
contact with the fat.

Searing. g Browning the surface of meat by the short application of
intense heat.

Simmering . g Cooking in water at a temperature of 180° to 210° F.,
or below the boiling point of water.

Steaming. g Cooking in the steam generated by boiling water.

Stewing . g Cooking in a small amount of water. The water may sim-
mer or boil, as indicated for the food that is to be cooked.
h. Cooking terms.

Baste . g To pour liquid over a piece of meat during roasting or broiling
to prevent drying. The liquid used may be pan drippings, water,
stock, milk, or melted butter.

Bouillon. g A soup stock made from lean beef, clarified by straining,
and seasoned. It may be used as soup stock or served as soup.

Broth . g The liquid resulting from simmering meat in water.

C on-HOmme . g A soup made from tw'o or more kinds of meat, then sea-
soned, strained, and served clear.

Drawn hutter. g ISIelted butter, flour, seasoning, and hot water used as
a sauce for fish and vegetables.

Lard. g Placing strips of fat on top of, or inserting into, meat to add
flavor and prevent dryness in roasting.

Lardoon. g A long, slender, pencil-like portion of salt pork, bacon, or
suet, used for larding.

Marinate. g To let stand in a mixture such as oil, vinegar, lemon juice,
and seasoning called a marinade.

Parhoil. g To boil until partly cooked.

Pot roast. g A piece of meat cooked by braising. Usually the less
tender meat cuts are prepared as pot roasts.

Stock. g ^The liquid obtained by simmering meat and bones. A good
base for soup and gravies.

53. Heat, use in cooking. g a. General .  While all the general
operations of the kitchen are called “cooking,” the term applies par-
ticularly to the application of heat to the food. This heat creates new
flavors in the food and generally improves its edible properties and
digestibility. Heat, assisted by moisture, swells and bursts the starch
cells in flour, rice, and potatoes; hardens the proteins of eggs, fish,
and meats ; and softens the fibrous substances in meats, vegetables, and
fruits. The quantity of heat depends upon the required temperature
and the time of cooking as well as the size, density, and other properties
of the food to be cooked.

h, Temferatv/ree cend times of cooking . g (1) Tables showing tem-
peratures and times of cooking for different foods are given in the
appendix. On examining the table of temperatures, it will be noted
that they vary greatly for different foods. Best results will be ob-
tained by using the temperature indicated for each food. Further,
this temperature must be uniformly maintained during the entire cook-
ing period. It must be remembered that it requires time for the heat
to penetrate to the center of the article being cooked. If the tempera-
ture is allowed to rise suddenly, the outside may become scorched or
burned before the center is cooked.

(2) The proper temperatures and times for cooking are also shown
in the recipes for various foods and dishes given in Chapter 2. How-
ever, a study of the table and observation of a few rules will greatly
assist the cook in understanding this important feature of cooking.
A knowledge of these general rules will insure good cooking even when
recipes are not available. These general rules are given below :

(a) In oven.

1. Starchy foods. g Starchy foods (breads, pies, potatoes,
squash, macaroni, etc.) are cooked at high temperature for
a short time. A quick oven (400® to 450® F.) is used and
the time of cooking is not over 1 hour.

Sweet dough products . g Sweet dough products (cinnamon
buns, coffee cake, etc.) and cakes, pastries, cookies, etc., are
baked in a medium oven (325® to 400® F.). These products
contain a high percentage of sugar and, because sugar will
caramelize (turn brown or black) easily in great heat, these
foods will scorch or bum on the outside before the inside

53


THE ARMY COOK


is cooked if they are cooked in heat greater than 400° F.
The time of cooking is not over 1 hour and usually less than
30 minutes.

3, Protein foods. g Protein foods (meats, beans, etc.) are roasted
or baked for a longer time than starchy foods, but the tem-
perature is lower. Meats are roasted in a moderate oven
(250° to 325° F.) or at simmering temperature (180° to
210° F.). Meats can be cooked at high temperatures (and
sometimes are so cooked by careless or inexperienced cooks),
but this impairs palatability and increases cooking losses
and nutritive value. Beans should be baked in a slow oven
as a high temperature toughens the skins.

(6) Frying . g ^All foods are fried at a relatively high temperature.
This is a necessity so that the hot fat will quickly seal the surface
and prevent grease penetration. In order to insure that the center
will be cooked before the outside has had time to become scorched,
fried foods are cut in relatively thin or small pieces. In other words,
a thick piece of meat or other food cannot be fried successfully if it
is to be well done. For these reasons (high temperatures and thin
pieces of food) frying is a quick method of cooking.

(c) Cooki/ng in water.

1. Vegetables. g ^Vegetables, when cooked in water, are cooked

at boiling temperature, with the exception of dry beans
which are simmered. Vegetables are boiled only long
enough to make them tender. They should never be cooked
longer than this. A maximum of 15 minutes is required for
the leafy vegetables (as cabbage, spinach, etc.) and between
30 and 45 minutes for the starchy and root vegetables (as
potatoes, carrots, onions, turnips, etc,). During cooking
some of the nutritive value of food is dissolved in the
water. If this liquid is not served with the food it should
be used for soups, gravies, stews, or sauces.

2. Beans., rice., and foste prod/ucts. g Dry soaked beans, peas,

or lentils are brought to a boil in the water in which they
are soaked, and simmered over low heat until tender.
They require a longer period of time than other vege-
tables. Rice is cooked in enough boiling water to cover
tmtil tender. It must be stirred frequently. Macaroni,
spaghetti, and noodles are boiled in large amounts of
water for a short period or until tender. Overcooking
causes a mushy, sticky product.

53-54


3. Meats . g Meats should never be boiled. They should be
simmered. This requires a longer cooking time than
vegetables.

G. Food 'particles to he of v/rviform size. g ^As explained in h (1)
above, it requires time for heat to penetrate to the center of food.
Therefore, a thick article of food, as a roast of beef, requires longer
than a thin article as a pork chop. If a roasting pan is filled with
pieces of beef, some weighing 2 pounds and others weighing 8 pounds,
the smaller pieces will be cooked first. Unless these smaller pieces
are removed from the oven they will become overcooked before the
larger pieces are cooked. Therefore, an effort should be made to cut
the pieces in uniform size. This also applies to potatoes and many
other foods.

54. Cooking in fat. g a. General .  Cooking in fat is done either
in shallow fat (just sufficient to form a film between the food and
the hot pan) or in deep fat (sufficient melted hot fat to cover the
food). Cooking in shallow fat is called sauteing by some chefs, and
some cookbooks call it pan frying; however, the term commonly used
in the United States is simply frying and foods so cooked are called
fried. Foods cooked in deep fat also are called fried except that
potatoes so cooked are called french fried. In this manual, when
it is desired to indicate that a food should be cooked in shallow
fat it will be called fried (example g potatoes, fried), and when it
is desired to indicate that a food should be cooked in deep fat, this
manual will use the expression, “fry in deep fat.”

h. Advantages . g Cooking in fat has the following advantages:

(1) It is a quick method of cooking.

(2) It gives a distinctive and pleasing flavor.

(3) Part of the fat is absorbed by the food, thus increasing nutritive
value.

c. Fried foods not to he served too often . g Fried foods should not
be served too often as men quickly tire of them; they are unhealth-
ful as a steady diet because of too much fat in the food and also
because fat is digested less easily than other foods.

d. Frying in deep fat compared 'with frying in shallow fat. g (1)
Frying in deep fat has advantages over frying in shallow fat. One
is that the flavor is better; another, that less time is required. The
chief advantage is that the food is entirely surrounded by hot fat
and therefore is cooked so quickly that there is not time for fat
absorption.

(2) In shallow fat the food is not entirely surrounded by hot fat

85

TM 10-405

54


THE ARMY COOK


and is not cooked as quickly as in deep fat. Therefore, foods fried
in shallow fat usually absorb more fat than if fried in deep fat.

(3) In deep fat the food does not come into contact with the pan.
In shallow fat the food is in contact with the hot pan and it fre-
quently becomes necessary to move the pan off the fire or reduce the
temperature to prevent scorching. Therefore, frying in shallow fat
should be done at a lower temperature than in deep fat. On ac-
count of this lower temperature it requires longer for the formation
of a crust on the outside of the food and longer to cook. Only
sufficient fat should be used to prevent burning in order to avoid
grease-soaked food.

e. Frying in deep fat, procedure. g (1) Proper temperature of
fat . g The fat must be hot so that the food is cooked quickly and a
crust is quickly formed on the outside. However, the fat must not
be heated until it smokes. Too hot a fat will scorch the outside of
the food and leave the center raw. Too low a temperature will
grease-soak the food being prepared. An experienced cook easily
recognizes this temperature. A good practical test is to drop into
the hot fat an inch cube of bread from the soft part of the loaf.
The bread will be golden brown in 60 seconds at the proper tempera-
ture for frying. If the cook is not certain that the fat has been
heated to the proper temperature, he should test it with a thermom-
eter. Lard substitute and vegetable shortening begin to smoke at
about 450° F. Pure lard begins to smoke at about 380° F. Frying
temperature should be between 350° and 375° F. The larger pieces
of food should be fried at the lower temperature to completely cook
the food.

(2) Fm/ing moist foods . g Care should be used in deep-fat frying
of foods which have a moist surface as the moisture may form steam
when it comes into contact with the hot fat, and this steam may
cause the fat to boil over and catch fire, or to pop out on the cook.
For example, potatoes prepared for french frying, which have been
immersed in water, should be drained before being put into hot fat.

(3) Avoid cooling fat . g ^Unless the fat is kept hot, it will not cook
the food quickly and will not quickly form a crust on the outside.
This will allow the fat to soak into the food. A common error is to
introduce too much food at one time (as in the frying of doughnuts),
thus cooling the fat. Another common error is to cool the fat by
introduction of foods which are cold on account of having been
frozen or kept in a refrigerator. Such foods should be kept in a
warm room sufficiently long to lose the chill before being fried.

(4) Drain foods after frying . g Foods fried in deep fat should be

86

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA



THE ARMY COOK


TM 10-405

54-55


drained after frying. This may be done in a colander, wire basket,
sieve, or by laying on paper. Ordinarly brown wrapping paper
will do.

(5) Fai clarifying . g The question often arises whether fat which
has been used for deep frying can be used again. To a great extent
this depends on whether the fat has been heated to the smoking
point, and whether any foods have been allowed to scorch or bum
in it. In either case the fat will impart a disagreeable odor and
taste to foods subsequently fried in it. It should be clarified. One
method of clarifying used fat is to strain it by pouring the warm
melted fat through a cloth. Two thicknesses of clean fiour sack
will suffice. This removes b.urned particles of food, but may not
entirely remove the disagreeable odor and taste. Additional clari-
fication may be accomplished by allowing the fat to cool until it
hardens; then melt it, add a few raw potatoes cut into quarter-inch
slices, and heat gradually. When the potatoes are well browned and
no bubbles appear on the surface, the fat should be strained. The
potatoes absorb the odors and most of the sediment and should be
discarded as they will be grease-soaked.

55. Seasoning of foods. g a. All foods placed on the mess table
should be seasoned so as to have a pleasing flavor. The quantities of
seasoning given in recipes are only a guide; the expert cook seasons
to taste. Because of the varying amounts of moisture, fat, sugar,
etc., in foods, it is difficult to prescribe exact quantities of spices and
other seasonings. Sometimes the cook falls into the error of assum-
ing that because he has added pepper and salt the flavor is satis-
factory. The only way to determine this is to taste the food.
Always use a clean spoon for testing. It is well to remember that
seasoning, once in the food, cannot be removed. It is better to use
too little than too much.

h. Left-over foods have usually been previously seasoned and great
care must be used in adding seasoning, especially salt, when pre-
paring them for subsequent meals.

c. The full strength of most spices, as sages, marjoram, cloves, etc.,
is not immediately noticeable in the food to which added, but in-
creases as the food is cooked. The heat and moisture gradually
bring out the full strength.

d. Garlic is used to advantage in seasoning meats, gravies, sauces,
soups, salads, and salad dressings, but must be used with judgment,
as many men do not care for any flavor of garlic, and to most per-
sons a pronounced garlic flavor is objectionable. Garlic flavor, when
present, should be delicate, which may be obtained by rubbing the

inside of the cooking utensil or salad bowl with a cut clove of garlic,
or the meat may be rubbed. A delicate flavor of garlic makes all
meats, especially roasts, more savory and appetizing, and gives a
tang to soups, stews, salad dressings, etc., which is very appealing.

e. As a general rule, food should be seasoned during the process
of cooking. Added flavoring and seasoning at the table cannot
make up for lack of proper flavoring and seasoning while cooking.
Vegetables should be cooked in salted water and more seasoning
added before serving, if necessary. Roasts and steaks may be sea- j
soiled during cooking or at time of serving. Pot roasts and stews
should be seasoned during cooking. Dishes prepared from ground
meats should be seasoned when prepared for cooking.

56. Methods of meat cookery. g a. General .  The method used
in cooking meat depends on the cut. The tender cuts have a small
amount of connective tissue and are cooked by dry heat: roasting,
broiling, and pan broiling. The less tender cuts with considerable
connective tissue must be cooked by moist heat because dry heat
toughens the connective tissue, while moist heat softens it. Methods
of cooking by moist heat are: braising, cooking in water (simmer-
ing), and stewing (small pieces simmered).

h. Roasting . g The time required to roast meats depends upon the
temperature of the oven, the size and shape of the piece of meat,
and the amount of fat. Well-done meat requires a longer time to
cook than rare meat; a large piece of meat requires longer to cook
than a small piece, but less time per pound ; fat meats tend to roast
more rapidly than lean meats. Meat can be cooked well-done at
any reasonable oven temperature, although the best results are ob-
tained with a moderate oven temperature (about 300° F.) because
the meat is cooked more evenly than in a hot oven. Furthermore,
there are less cooking losses, more juice, more servings, and the
meat is more palatable. It is not necessary to sear meat before
cooking, except to develop flavor on the outer surface. Browning
of the meat juices in the pan after the meat is done will develop flavor
for gravies. The gravy of roasted meats plays an important part
in a satisfying meal. A good gravy is as important as well-roasted
meat.

(1) Beef . g Wipe the roast with a damp cloth. (Meat should
never be washed or soaked in water.) Place meat in a pan with fat
side up. Roast at 300° to 350° F. For meat well-done, allow 50 to
60 minutes per pound for rolled roasts, and 40 to 50 minutes for
unboned roasts.

(2) Veal . g Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. Place in roaster

with the outside of the roast up and place string of salt pork or
bacon over the top. Place in an oven heated to 375° F. for black
pans, or 375° to 400° F. for aluminum pans, when covered. Allow
approximately 30 to 35 minutes per pound. As veal contains con-
siderable amounts of connective tissue, it requires a moist heat and
should be cooked in a covered pan.

(3) Pork. g Place the roast in the pan with the fat side up. For
fresh pork, place in an oven at 325° to 350° F. and cook until done g
from 30 to 35 minutes per pound. Cured pork is cooked at a
slightly lower temperature (250° F.) and usually requires from 25
to 35 minutes per pound.

(4) Lamh. g Same as for roast beef.

c. Pan broiling. g ^The cuts which lend themselves best to pan
broiling are tender beefsteaks, lamb or mutton chops or steaks, ham,
and bacon. The broiling should be done on a hot plate or frying
pan, uncovered, pouring off fat as it accumulates in the pan. Sear
the meat quickly on both sides, and then cook more slowly until
the desired degree of doneness is reached. Bacon is put into a cold
pan, cooked slowly and the fat poured off frequently.

d. Braising. g Meat for braising should be cut quite thin. A lit-
tle fat is melted in a hot frying pan. The meat is browned quickly
on both sides and then cooking continued at a lower temperature in
a covered pan. The cuts of meat usually cooked by braising are
round steaks, veal steaks or chops, and pork chops.

e. Pot roast of beef. g Cuts of beef suitable for a pot roast are
chuck, ribs, clod, round, and rump. Rub the roast with salt, pepper,
and flour. Brown the meat on all sides in a small amount of
melted beef fat. After searing, add a small amount of water, cover
tightly, and simmer until tender. Time required : about 3 hours.

f. Stewing. g A. stew is a dish made from small pieces of meat.
This is an excellent way to utilize trimmings and less tender cuts of
meat. The vegetables are added to stews at the time and in the
order required to cook them satisfactorily with the least loss of
nutritive value. There are three methods for making stews:

(1) The meat may be browned before the water is added. This
gives the meat a “roast” flavor and the gravy a rich color.

(2) The meat may be plunged into boiling water. This will not
have the rich flavor of the browned meat but the vegetables cooked
with the stew will have more of the meat flavor.

(3) The meat may be placed into cold water and brought to a
simmer. The broth in which the meat is cooked will have a rich
flavor and the meat eaten by itself will be somewhat tasteless.

57. Meats, carving and serving. g a. General .  (1) The chief
objectives of good carving are to obtain attractiveness and the best
flavor from the meat, and to prevent waste. Meat should never be
carved with a hard, sawing motion. Carved meat should be placed on
the platter with the most appetizing side up and the pieces arranged
in an attractive manner, not thrown loosely on the platter. It
requires no expense, and very little effort, to arrange meat neatly
on a platter so that it will be pleasing to the eye.

(2) Good carving cannot be accomplished without good tools.
Sharp carving knives are essential. Knives should be run over a
steel just before starting to carve and frequently during the carving,
if the amount of carving warrants. (See fig. 1.) The steel should
be held in the left hand, in a nearly horizontal position (the point
slightly raised) and parallel to the body. The knife should be held j
in the right hand. Start the blade along one side of the steel, begin- |
ning with the heel of the knife at the point of the steel. The strokes
should be reversed from side to side of the steel. All hand motion
of the knife blade along the steel should be in the wrist and not a
movement of the entire forearm. The touch of the blade on the
steel should be light and six strokes should be sufficient; if more are
required, the knife should be sharpened on a stone. If the knife is
sharp the cut will be clean and even.

h. Carving rih roasts . g Beef should be sliced across the grain into
pieces of uniform size and thickness convenient for individual serv-
ice, not cut into chunks. Rib roasts are tempting and appetizing
when neatly sliced across but have no appeal if cut into chunks. An |
excellent way of carving a rib roast is as follows: Stand the roast |
on end on a carving board or wooden table with the rib bones to
the left of, and with the meat side away from, a right-handed
carver. Stick a large meat fork in the bone side of the roast, low
enough that the knife will not strike the fork, and hold the roast
firm with the fork in the left hand; cut thin slices across the grain
until the knife reaches the bone. Cut several slices in this manner,
leaving them attached to the bone and then run the point of the
knife along the bone, releasing the slices. By this method all the
meat can be cut from the bones except the small strings between
the ribs.

c. Carving rounds roasts . g Use a long, thin knife. To start the
carving, place the roast on a carving board with the large or rump
end down and the small or shank end up. Start at the outer edge
of the meat and cut across the face (across the grain) of the roast,
cutting toward the round bone and making the slices about % inch

thick. As the knife approaches the bone, raise the edge so that it
will come to the surface just as it reaches the bone. Each slice
should be about the size of the hand. Continue slicing around the
roast, turning it so as to keep the cut surface of the roast level.

d,. Preparation and carving of pork loin roasts. g ^Pork loins con-
tain the backbone and part of the rib. The backbone should be
cracked with a cleaver at about 1-inch intervals before roasting the
meat. This enables the carver to cut slices from the loin through
the meat and the bone. The slices should be about ^ inch thick and
every other slice will contain a piece of the backbone and the rib.

58. Poultry, methods of cooking. g a. Boasting.  Young cock-
erels weighing from 3% to 5 pounds and over, and turkeys, ducks,
and geese, are used for roasting. The whole drawn bird is usually
roasted and stuffed with any desired stuffing. Brush the skin of
the bird with melted or softened fat. Place in a slow oven (250®
F.), breast up, in an uncovered pan. Place strips of body fat re-
moved in dressing over the breastbone. Bacon or salt pork strips
may be used. Allow 25 to 30 minutes per pound.

6. Broiling. g Only young, tender chickens should be used for
broiling. As the birds are small they are cut in half and placed on
the broiler rack, rib side up. Cook until tender and brown, turning
frequently. The fire should not be too hot or the outside will brown
and the inside remain raw. Cooking time about 20 minutes.

c. Frying. g ^For fryjng, the chicken is cut into four to six pieces.
Roll each piece in flour or other mixture and saute in a little fat
until brown and tender. If the chicken is not young, it is advisable
to parboil or steam it before frying.

d. Stewing or fricassee. g Cut up the chicken as for frying. Brown
in a pan with fat, cover with boiling water, season, and simmer
until tender. The liquid is then thickened with cornstarch or flour
before serving.

59. Fish, cookery. g a. Fish are a healthful and delicious food, if
properly prepared. Salt water fish are an important source of
bromine and iodine^ In all fish the protein or tissue-building mate-
rial is excellent.

h. Fish may be divided as follows:

(1) White fish. g Fish that have less than 5 percent fat, examples of
which are smelt, flounder, yellow perch, pike, pickerel, cod, and
haddock.

(2) Fat or oily fish. g ^Fish that contain 5 percent or more of fat,
examples of which are salmon, herring, lake trout, mackerel, and eels.

(3) Shellfish. g Oysters, claims, scallops, lobsters, crabs, shrimps,
and prawns.

&lt; 7 . Fresh fish, or fish that were frozen while fresh, have full or
bulging eyes, bright red gills, firm and elastic flesh, and fresh odor.
Be sure the flesh along the backbone smells fresh; it spoils there
first. Fresh fish sink in fresh water. If they float, they should not
be used. Frozen fish need not be thawed before cooking. In case
the fish have not been cleaned, they should be thawed only sufficiently
to permit cleaning and then cooked. Frozen fish that come cleaned
should be cooked without thawing, allowing slightly more than the
usual time for cooking.

d, . To fresh salt fish, place the flesh side down in a pan of fresh
water, and let soak from 1 to 48 hours, changing water several times.
If the fish are to be cooked in liquid, they will need a shorter time in
soak than if they are to be cooked with very little moisture.

e. Fish must be well cooked to be palatable and wholesome. They
are cooked sufficiently when the flesh separates easily from the bones.
If underdone, they are not eatable; if cooked too long, they are dry
and lose most of their flavor. All of the various methods of cooking
may be applied to fish. The principal thing is to be sure that the
fish are well cooked and still not overcooked. Frying and deep-fat
frying are the most popular methods of preparing fish in the Army.
The fat for deep-fat frying should be maintained at 360° F. For
large pieces the fat should be slightly lower temperature.

60. Vegetable cookery. g a. General .  The method of cooking
vegetables will usually have a decided effect, either good or bad,
upon their color, odor, flavor, or nutritive value. In some vegetables
one method of cooking will preserve all these qualities, in others it
may be necessary to sacrifice one or two to preserve the third, but
it is never necessary to sacrifice all four as is frequently the case.
In general, vegetables should be cooked as short a time as possible.

5. Preservation of color . g ^Vegetables naturally fall into four
groups of color : green, yellow, red, and creamy white.

(1) Chlorophyll, the coloring pigment of green vegetables, is easily
destroyed by heat and acid. When green vegetables are cooked for a
long time in a small amount of water or steam in a covered vessel
or under pressure, the chlorophyll is decomposed. Vegetables which
can be quickly cooked, such as spinach or mustard greens, will retain
their green color if not overcooked, but other items which require
20 to 30 minutes to cook will lose a considerable amount of their
green color. The general rule for the preservation of green color is
to drop them into boiling water and cook them uncovered for the
shortest possible time.

(2) Yellow color found in carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes comes

60


from a class of pigments called “carotinoids” which is always asso-
ciated with the chlorophyll in green vegetables, but remains invisible
until the latter is dissipated. This yellow color is largely due to
carotene which the body transforms into vitamin A. It is relatively
stable to heat but is destroyed by oxidation. It is necessary to con-
sider these facts when cooking yellow vegetables. When green vege-
tables are overcooked the chlorophyll is dissipated, and the little
which remains, together with the yellow pigment, gives the item a
greenish bronze appearance. The yellow pigment is very stable and
vegetables which have only this color can be cooked in any method
without affecting any color change, but overcooking will tend to
destroy carotene. When yellow vegetables turn dark brown it is
usually the result of oxidation (improper care after preparation for
cooking, and overcooking) or a scorching or caramelization of the
sugar content.

(3) Red color is rather rare, being found in beets, tomatoes, red
cabbages, and radishes. This color will remain red in the presence
of acid but turns to violet or purple when cooked in an alkaline water.
To preserve the red color when cooking red vegetables a little vinegar
or lemon juice should be added to the water. Tomatoes and unpeeled
beets can be cooked without added vinegar and retain their color
because they have sufficient acid content. The acid also tends to retard
the destruction of ascorbic acid.

(4) White vegetables are fairly stable in heat. White vegetables
will turn a grayish color when a long time is consumed in the cooking.
Discoloration can be avoided by the simple expedient of a “short cook,”
that is, only enough to make the vegetable tender.

c. Preservation of fia/oor . g So far as cooking for retention of flavor
is concerned, vegetables divide themselves into three classes : the cab-
bage family, which includes brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and turnips ;
the onion family, including garlic, shallots, and chives; all other
vegetables.

(1) The vegetables of the cabbage family contain sulfur compounds
which break up easily under the application of heat and produce prod-
ucts which are disagreeable to the sense of taste and smell. One of
these substances is hydrogen sulfide, the same gas which causes rotten
eggs to have such an offensive odor. Decomposition of the sulfur com-
pound is brought about by long cooking or by cooking at low tempera-
tures, which should be avoided. Vegetables of the cabbage family
should never be cooked in a pressure cooker as all of the volatile acids
evolved from the vegetables are retained. Such vegetables should be
cooked in the shortest possible time in an uncovered vessel and in a
large amount of water.

(2) The onion family is really the “strong-juiced” group. They
obtain their strength from certain volatile and aromatic substances
formed in the growing stage. They do not behave like the cabbage
family in cooking, for they do not form new odors or flavors but
simply loose part of those present. When heat is applied, the volatile
substances begin to dissipate with the steam. The properties which
provide a pleasing flavor do not always provide a pleasing odor.
With long cooking, the flavor is entirely volatilized and the resultant
product is insipid and flat in flavor. Thus the flavor of these vege-
tables is controlled through the length of time they are cooked.

(3) All other vegetables lose flavor when cooked in a large amount
of water and the method best suited for their preparation is to cook
them in the least possible amount of water, or in a steamer or pressure
cooker.

d. Preservation of nutrients . g The inherent nutritive value of foods
may be affected by storage, preparation, cooking, and service. It is
necessary to give preference to those procedures which will retain
the maximum nutritive value. In general, foods should be stored in
a cool place ; prepared with a minimum of handling, soaking, or re-
moval of parts; and cooked the shortest time and at the lowest tem-
peratures compatible with palatability. Food should be served as soon
as possible after it is done. The three principally employed methods
of cooking vegetables are baking, steaming, and boiling. These will
be considered solely from the standpoint of nutrient savings.

(1) Baking means cooking in dry heat in an oven, with the addi-
tion of little or no water. This is a good method of cooking as nutri-
tive losses are small, the chief loss being vitamin C. There will be
some loss of Bj, depending upon the temperature, length of time the
product is baked, and if the skins are left intact.

(2) The next best method is steaming. This can be done either in
a vessel where the temperature never exceeds that of boiling or in a
pressure cooker where 249° F. can be attained. The cooking is accom-
plished without the addition of water to the vegetables except a small
quantity necessary for the steam. The special advantage of this
method lies in the fact that the only water which comes in contact
with the vegetables is the minute quantity which is formed by con-
densation of the steam.

(3) More nutrients are lost by boiling vegetables than by any other
method of cooking. The loss is in direct proportion to the time of
cooking and the exposed surface of the vegetables. When vegetables
are exposed to the solvent action of water, the smaller the pieces into
which they are cut, the greater will be the loss of nutrients. Some part

60-61


of the minerals and other nutrients which have escaped into the boiling
water can be recaptured by using the water in which the vegetables
are boiled for soup, and this should be done as far as possible.

61. Soups. g a. General .  ^When beef is issued in carcass form the
bones should not be discarded; they should be used for soup stock.
An inspector never finds a raw bone in the garbage can of a well-
conducted mess. Soups can be made the means of preventing waste
by incorporating in them food which might otherwise be wasted,
such as all raw beef bones, excess liquid from canned vegetables, left-
over cooked vegetables, and vegetable scraps (celery, onion, and
beet tops, lettuce, and cabbage trimmings). If meat is used in soup,
it should be cut into small cubes, as this aids in dissolving the meat
juices into the soup by exposing more surface to the heat.

h. Soup stock . g pot for soup stock should be found in every
Army kitchen. To make soup stock, crack the bones and cut the
meat into small pieces. Put bones and meat in a large container
with a close-fitting cover and add 1 quart of water for each pound
of meat and bones. Heat slowly to the simmering point and add
salt; simmer for 4 to 6 hours, then cool. Fat will form on the top
after cooling and should not be taken off until the time to use the
stock, as this layer of fat acts as a preservative by excluding the air.
In warm weather soup stock may sour if kept for more than 24 hours.
If neceessary to keep longer than 24 hours, the stock should be steri-
lized by being brought to a boil at intervals of 24 hours or less. Stock
can be used as the base for either gravies or soups and to enrich many
dishes, such as hash, meat loaf, and sauces.

c. Value as food . g Soups may provide appreciable amounts of min-
erals and sometimes vitamins. Thick or cream soups also provide
appreciable amounts of energy. Soups have an important place in
the menu. In addition to their food value, they stimulate the flow of
digestive juices and thus aid digestion. Soup should always be
served very hot.

d. How made. g (1) Most soups are made by first making a stock.
This stock is the base of the soup. It gives strength and flavor.
Before making the soup the stock is allowed to cool. This results
in the fat rising to the top and hardening so that it can be removed
easily. It should be removed to prevent the soup being greasy. To
the stock the cook adds mixed vegetables if a vegetable soup is
desired, or beans if bean soup is desired, etc. Each soup should be
well seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices such as bay leaves
or marjoram. Meat may be added to many soups, if desired.

(2) Some soups are made without stock. These are usually cream

THE ARMY COOK


soups (cream of cabbage, cream of celery, etc.) However, a stock
may be used as the base of cream soups if desired, for the added
flavor and nutritive value it gives.

e. Kinds . g (1) Thin smips .  Thin soups like bouillon and con-
somme are not often served in Army messes as most soldiers prefer
a thick soup ; however, bouillon or consomme, if served occasionally,
is acceptable and gives variety.

(а) Bouillon. g k. soup stock made from lean beef, clarified and
seasoned.

(б) Consomme . g A soup made from two or more kinds of meat,
clarified and served either hot or cold.

(2) Cream sowps.g Cream soups are made by boiling vegetables (as
cabbage, celery, tomatoes, etc.) in water or stock, with seasoning,
until the vegetables are tender, then thickening with a batter made
from flour and fat and adding milk just before serving. Use of an
acid vegetable (as tomatoes) sometimes causes the milk to curdle.
This can be prevented by adding a pinch of soda (or about 1 tea-
spoonful for 100 men). If too much soda is added, the soup will
have a disagreeable soda taste. Cream soups include cream of
asparagus, cabbage, celery, and tomato.

(3) Purees . g Purees are made from vegetables (or fish) which
are cooked in stock until very tender and then forced through a
colander or sieve to make a mush, which is then put back into the
stock. A batter of flour and fat is added to thicken the soup, which
is then allowed to simmer about 1 hours before serving. Milk may
be added if desired. Purees include puree of beans, carrots, green
peas, lima beans, potato, tomato, etc.

(4) Oyster stew . g Oyster stew (sometimes called oyster soup) is
made by adding flour to the liquor drained from the oysters, to make
a thin batter, which is added to the soup stock for thickening and
flavor. The oysters are added just before serving. The stew is then
seasoned and boiled for 5 minutes. Milk may be used if desired, and
improves the flavor.

(5) Chowders . g Chowders are soups usually made from fish or
clams, although corn or potatoes are occasionally used instead. Vege-
tables and diced bacon are usually added. The vegetables and bacon
may be boiled in stock with the fish or clams, etc., until tender; or
when onions and bacon are included, they may be browned in a
frying pan before being added. Chowders are usually thickened
with a batter of flour and melted fat. Milk is often added just before
serving. Chowders should be well seasoned. They include clam,
codfish (or other fish) , corn, and potato chowders.

(6) Meat soups. g ^Meat soups are made by simmering meats (usu-
ally beef) or poultry (usually chicken) until tender, then dicing
the meat and adding to stock. Usually rice is added.

62. Gravy. g Gravy is the fat and juices that drip from meat
while being cooked. When the clear drippings are served without
the addition of other ingredients it is known as “natural gravy” and
is usually served with the meat. For a brown gravy, flour is added
to the drippings and fried until brown. Then meat stock, water, or
milk, is added, a little at a time, and stirred continuously until the
desired thickness of gravy is had. The quantity of flour and liquid
added to the drippings regulates the amount of gravy and its con-
sistency. Greasy gravy can be avoided by using only the amount of
drippings necessary and the use of suflicient flour to absorb all the
drippings before adding the liquids. When the quantity of drippings
is insufficient, additional fat may be added to the drippings.

63. Salads. g a. Fruits, nuts, uncooked and cooked vegetables,
cooked meats, fish and fowl, served cold and dressed with condiments,
oils, and acids, are known as salads.

h. The following fundamentals must be observed in the preparation
of salads :

(1) ~W ashing ingredients. g ^Wash salad greens and examine to in-
sure the removal of all insects. Then soak in cold water to crisp, and
dry by shaking in a wire basket.

(2) Chilling. g ^All ingredients, fruits, vegetables, and dressing
should be chilled before mixing.

(3) Cutting up materials. g Salad materials should be cut in uni-
form pieces small enough so that they will not lose their shape when
mixed. When meat is used it should be diced and not ground.

(4) Mixing. g When mixing the materials they should be lightly
tossed with two forks or the hands. The salad dressing should never
be added to the salad until time for serving, except in the case of
potato salad, when it is preferable for the dressing to soak in. The
dressing should be folded in. Excess dressing should be avoided ; only
sufficient added to coat the separate pieces of material. Free dressing
in the bottom of the dish is an indication that too much dressing was
added.

(5) Garnishing. g The salad should be attractively served. If indi-
vidual salads are served, the plate should be garnished with lettuce,
parsley, green pepper, or similar small greens. Other garnishes that
may be used are strips of pimento, dash of paprika, shredded carrots,
whole radishes, cherries, or grapes.

64. Baking^. g a. General.  (1) Every cook should have a good
working knowledge of baking to supplement the bakery goods sup-
plied by the post bakery. Breads are divided into two general
classes : fermented and unfermented.

(а) Fermented bread is leavened by the gas formed by yeast. The
yeast also acts upon the gluten and starch, making them more di-
gestible, and gives a distinctive flavor not present in unleavened bread.
There are two principal types of yeast bread: plain dough used in
baking bread ; and sweet dough, which contains more sugar, shorten-
ing, and eggs, and is used for rolls, cinnamon rolls, and coffee cakes.

(б) Unfermented breads are made without yeast, generally being
leavened with baking powder. These products include biscuits, muf-
fins, pancakes, corn bread, and waffles.

(2) Good baked products can be obtained only through the use
of good ingredients and the exact weights and measures given in the
formula. In cooking you taste and adjust ingredients as you prepare
and cook the food. In baking this cannot be done, so you must follow
instructions and formulas implicitly.

&amp;. Ingredients. g (1) Flour .  ^Flour is the chief ingredient of baked
goods. There are three types of white flour to consider for baking.
Hard wheat (also classified as spring wheat) flours are best for bread
making. This is because the gluten of hard wheat flour possesses
properties of toughness and elasticity which enable the dough to
stretch and hold gases produced in it by the action of yeast. Soft
flours are usually milled from winter wheat, which is generally poor
in gluten but rich in starch, and generally used for the baking of
pastry and cakes. “All purpose flour” is a blend of flours that is
higher in gluten than the hard- wheat flours. This flour is used for
sweet doughs. This flour will also give satisfactory results for pastry
and cakes. Bread flour will also give a satisfactory cake if a richer
formula is used, that is, more shortening, sugar, and eggs.

(2) Yeast . g ^The most satisfactory temperature for the growth of
yeast is from 75° to 90° F. It ceases to grow when the temperature is
below 30° F. and is killed at about 200° F. Three types of yeast are
in general use for bread making :

(a) In compressed yeast the yeast plants are alive and ready for
action. It is very perishable and must be kept under refrigeration
until it is to be used. When old, compressed yeast becomes slightly
slippery and has an unpleasant odor.

(&amp;) Dehydrated yeast is in granular form and is handled in the
same manner as compressed yeast. It has better keeping qualities
than compressed yeast. This yeast will keep its leavening qualities

for several weeks after removal from the refrigerator and for that
reason is a good yeast for use where daily delivery of compressed yeast
cannot be made.

(c) Dry yeast is a mass of yeast plants dried to spore stage, mixed
with corn meal, and pressed into cakes. This yeast will keep for
several months under ordinary storage. As the dried plants are
inactive they take some time to become active again after warmth,
moisture, food, and air are supplied. When dried yeast is used for
baking, the sponge method should be used.

(3) Baking powder . g ^The leavening best suited for the production
of pancakes, biscuits, cakes, and doughnuts is baking powder. Baking
powders may be classified by rapidity of gas release as slow or quick
acting. Quick'acting will release all of the leavening gas (carbon
dioxide) in the cold when added to the dough. The slow acting will
release part of the gas in the cold but requires heat to complete the
action. Some slow acting baking powders are also known as “double
acting” as part of the action takes place in the cold and part after
exposure to heat. The quick acting baking powders are not suitable
for the baking of pancakes or doughnuts as the leavening escapes
from the dough while waiting to be baked. A general rule to follow
in the use of baking powder is one-half ounce of slow or double
acting powder to 1 pound of flour or 1 ounce of quick acting baking
powder to 1 pound of flour. Use of the following table will assist
the cook in determining what powder he is using :

(4) Baking soda . g Baking soda may be used as a leavening agent
in the presence of acid, that is, with sour milk or vinegar. Canned
milk can be converted into sour milk by adding 3 tablespoonfuls of
vinegar to a 14)4 -ounce can of evaporated milk. Baking soda is also
used in baking of cakes where an acid product such as chocolate is
used to neutralize the acid for proper leavening effect and give the
chocolate a darker color.

(5) Eggs . g Eggs are used for leavening cakes made without

shortening, such as sponge and angel cake. They serve as part of
the leavening in “butter” cakes, muffins, and other quick breads.

(6) Miscellaneous ingredients. g The liquids used with yeast should
be scalded to kill any organisms which might develop in the dough
and then cooled to lukewarm before the yeast is added. The liquids
used with baking powder should be at room temperature. All in-
gredients must be carefully measured or weighed to obtain best re-
sults. Excess amount of any one ingredient may result in an inferior
product or failure.

(7) Oven temperatures. g The proper control of oven temperatures
is another important procedure in baking. Pies should be placed in
a hot oven, 500® F. for 10 minutes to set the shortening in the dough
and then reduced to 350° F. to bake the filling. Bread should be
baked at 450° F. to obtain the best volume and texture. The sweeter
products should be baked at lower temperatures to avoid burning
the sugar ; sweet doughs at 400° F. and cakes at 350° F.

65. Beverages. g ^The beverages most used in Army messes are
coffee, tea, cocoa, and lemonade. Fruit punches may be served occa-
sionally in hot weather if the cost is moderate.

a. Coffee. g (1) Rules for making.  ^In brewing coffee any
method, the following rules should be strictly observed:

(а) Keep supply of roasted coffee in airtight containers. g ^Expos-
ure to air causes roasted coffee to lose rapidly some of its flavor and
strength.

(б) Use ground coffee only once. g Coffee grounds from which coffee
has been made should always be thrown away. Never use them the
second time. Coffee made from them is sure to have a bitter and
unpleasant flavor. This is true even if fresh roasted coffee and old
grounds are mixed. To mix fresh coffee and old grounds is a waste,
not a saving.

(c) Use fresh hoHing water. g ^The water must be boiling to extract
all the desirable flavors from the coffee. It must be fresh. Water
which has boiled for a long time has a flat taste which will appear in
the coffee.

(«?) Regulate preparation of coffee so that it will he ready not more
than 10 minutes before serving time . g Once prepared, coffee loses its
flavor rapidly and if held more than 30 minutes becomes bitter.

(e) Never make more than enough coffee for one meal. g ^Warmed-
over coffee is bitter and has lost aroma.

{f) Scour coffeepot . g ^Unless thoroughly scoured daily, some of the
spent grounds and oils of the coffee will stick in the comers of the
pot and impart a bitter taste to subsequent brews.

( ff) If filter hags are med^ they should not he dried, neither should
they he washed in hot water. g Hot water cooks in the coffee stains
throughout the filter bag and, in subsequent brews, imparts a bitter
and. off flavor to the coffee. After the bag is rinsed in cold water,
submerge it in cool or cold water until time to use it again.

(2) Coffee for cooks. g ^It is the practice of some cooks to make
the coffee for breakfast as soon as the fire is started in the morning in
order to have coffee for themselves. This is bad practice. It means
that stale and bitter coffee is served at the mess table. Every mess
should have a small coffeepot, percolator, or tricolator for the purpose
of providing good hot coffee for the kitchen detail, members of the
guard, etc,, who desire coffee earlier or later than the regular serving
time for the organization. In making small quantities, use a level
tablespoonful of ground coffee to each cup of water and add 1 level
tablespoonful for the pot.

(3) Proper quantities. g One pint of coffee per man is ample for
one meal. This is 12i/^ gallons for 100 men or gallons for 20 men.
For each 20 men use 1 pound of roasted and ground coffee and 2^ gal-
lons of water. Therefore, to find the number of pounds of roasted
and ground coffee, divide the number of men to be served by 20. For
example, if 80 men are to be served, 4 pounds of coffee are required.
To find the number of gallons of water, multiply the number of
pounds of ground coffee by 2^. Thus, for 80 men, 4 pounds of
ground coffee and 10 gallons of water are required. These propor-
tions of ground coffee and water should be used regardless of the
method of preparation g whether boiled, or made in percolators,
tricolator, etc.

(4) Methods of brewing. g (a) Boiled coffee.  Heat fresh water in
a separate container until it has just reached the boiling point. Place
the ground coffee in a cloth sack ; tie the top. Ground coffee expands
in water, therefore leave plenty of room in the sack for this expansion.
Place the sack of ground coffee in the coffeepot or boiler and pour the
water over it ; or, the sack of coffee may be suspended or dropped into
the water. Keep hot on the back of the stove ; do not permit boiling.
The value of a cloth sack is that the grounds can be removed easily as
soon as the coffee is brewed. Sometimes a sack may not be available.
In this case the ground coffee is placed in the bottom of the pot or
boiler and the boiling water poured over it ; at the end of 10 minutes
heating over a slow fire, settle the coffee by the addition of a small
quantity of cold water.

(&amp;) Percolated coffee. g ^Use either cold or hot water. The use of
hot water reduces the length of time required to complete the brew.

For quantities in excess of 20 cups the coffee will be ready to serve in
10 minutes after it starts coming over the top of the tube. For
smaller quantities 8 minutes is sufficient.

{c) Filtered or drip cofee . g This is made in a utensil having three
compartments, the upper for water, the center for ground coffee, and
the lower for the brewed beverage. Filter papers are usually pro-
vided to be placed on the bottom of the center compartment before
putting in the ground coffee. This type of utensil is sold under vari-
ous trade names as “Tricolator,” “Filtrator,” etc. For best results
the coffee must be finely ground. Place the filter paper in the bottom
of the center compartment, add the ground coffee and cover with the
perforated metal cover which is usually provided; then pour in boil-
ing or fresh water. When all the water has filtered through the
ground coffee and into the lower compartment, the beverage is ready
to serve. Before serving, stir the beverage to equalize strength
throughout. Some arrangement must be made to keep the lower
compartment hot but not boiling. If of earthenware or glassware,
keep it in a pan of hot water until just before serving. If of alumi-
num or other metal it should be placed on the back of the stove. Do
not permit the brewed coffee to boil.

h. Tea. g (1) Tea should be served hot occasionally in lieu of coffee.
In the summer months it should be served often as an iced beverage,
especially at the noon meal.

(2) Tea should be made in glass or earthenware utensils, if avail-
able, as metal utensils give an off flavor and tend to blacken the tea.

(3) One to three ounces of tea to 1 gallon of water should be used in
making tea, depending on the quality of the tea and the strength of
the beverage desired. Two ounces of tea leaves to 1 gallon of water
should make a beverage to suit the average person.

(4) Bring the required quantity of water to a boil. Place the dry
tea in a clean cotton bag, tie the top, and drop the bag into the boiling
water. Tea expands in water, therefore, leave plenty of room in the
bag for expansion. Allow the bag of tea to remain in the water for
6 or 7 minutes, then remove it. If tea leaves are allowed to remain
in the water longer than 7 minutes the tea becomes stronger and bitter.
Agitate the bag of tea three or four times during the period it is in
the water. Stir the tea just before serving, to equalize strength
throughout. If not stirred the tea on the bottom of the container
will be stronger than that on top. Unlike coffee, tea may be made sev-
eral hours before serving, if kept in earthenware or glass containers,
as it does not lose its flavor and aroma. If lemons are available, they
may be sliced and served with the tea in lieu of milk, for those
desiring this.

(5) Tea to be used as an iced drink should be made in concentrated
form. Use the total required quantity of tea leaves, and one-fifth the
I'equired amount of water. Prepare the same as hot tea, but a suffi-
cient time in advance to permit cooling. Just before serving, add the
remainder of the water, either cold water or chipped ice or a com-
bination of the two, and stir vigorously in order to equalize strength
throughout. Added lemon materially improves the fiavor.

c. Cocoa. g (1) Cocoa makes a good beverage, especially for the
evening meal. Five ounces of cocoa to 1 gallon of liquid makes a
beverage of average strength. The best results are obtained when the
liquid used consists of 75 percent milk and 25 percent water. The
quantity of milk may be reduced, with corresponding increase in the
quantity of water when it becomes necessary to reduce cost. Cocoa
made with water alone lacks palatability and body, and is generally
unsatisfactory.

(2) Some cooks make cocoa by placing the ground cocoa in a pot,
adding hot water, bringing to a boil, then adding sugar and milk. A
better method is first to make a thick paste with the ground cocoa,
sugar, and a little hot water. This method prevents lumpiness.

(3) Some cooks prefer to leave out the sugar when making cocoa
so that the men may add it at the table according to individual taste.
This is a matter of mess management.

1 In Alaska the beef component will be increased by 10 percent, the bacon component by 33 H percent,
and the vegetable component by 20 percent.

&gt; On Thanksgiving Day and on Christmas Day the meat component will be as follows: Turkey,
drawn, 25 ounces; turkey, undrawn, 28 ounces.

* Alternate forequarters and hindquarters.

4 In the Philippine Islands and at remote stations where it is impracticable to procure fresh milk, the
milk allowance will be 6 ounces of evaporated milk.

4 When it is impracticable to bake soft bread, or if for any reason it is more economical to purchase than to
bake it, soft bread will be a component in lieu of an equal quantity of flour. In such instances it is prescribed
that 8 ounces of bread, soft, and 4 ounces of flour will be the component in lieu of the flour component.

(2) How issued g ration savings privilege .  The garrison ration is
not issued in the form of food. The allowance is in cash; that is,
the quartermaster gives each mess a money credit for the money
value of the ration and the mess may use this money credit for the

68


purchase of any desired kind of food. For example, if a company
mess had a strength of 100 men on July 1 and the value of the ration
for July is 30 cents, the quartermaster gives the mess credit for $30.
The mess may purchase food from the quartermaster up to a value
of $30; or if it purchases less than $30 worth, it is entitled to the
saving in cash. This is called the ration savings privilege. The
cash savings go into the company fund and may be spent at any
later date for food. For convenience, the accounts are settled by
the quartermaster once a month.

6. Field ration. g (1) The field ration is that prescribed for use
only in time of war or national emergency when the garrison ration
is not used. It will be issued in kind and no ration savings will be
allowed. Its components and substitutes will be prescribed by the
War Department or the commander of the field forces and will con-
sist of the following:

(а) Field ration A. g This ration will correspond as nearly as
practicable to the components or substitutes therefor of the garrison
ration. This type of field ration will be issued as often as circum-
stances will permit.

(б) Field ration B. g ^This ration will correspond as nearly as
practicable to the components of field ration A with the exception
that nonperishable processed or canned products will replace items
of a perishable nature.

(c) Field ration C. g This ration will consist of previously cooked
or prepared food, packed in hermetically sealed cans, which may be
eaten either hot or cold, and will consist of six cans per ration as
follows :

3 cans containing a meat and vegetable component.

3 cans containing crackers, sugar, soluble coffee, and a confec-
tion.

{d) Field ration D. g This ration will consist of three 4-ounce bars
of concentrated chocolate.

(e) Field ration K. g ^This ration is intended for parachute, air-
borne, and highly mobile units. It consists of previously cooked or
prepared food packed in boxes, wrapped so as to be impervious to
moisture and gas. It consists of three boxes per ration, each con-
taining especially fortified biscuits, canned meat, malted milk tablets,
and chewing gum. The breakfast box also contains soluble coffee and
sugar; the dinner box, bouillon paste; the supper box, lemonade
powder.

(2) In time of war, types C, D, or K field rations are to be issued
only upon order of the commander of the field forces. In time of

peace, such of these types as are available may, for training purposes,
be utilized when directed by proper authority.

(3) When deemed advisable a combination of types C and D may
constitute the field ration. This will normally consist of two cans
of the meat and vegetable component, two cans of the crackers, sugar,
and soluble coffee, and two each of the 4-ounce bars of concentrated
chocolate.

*69. Use of rations. g a. The cook is not concerned with the com-
ponent articles of the garrison ration. The organization commander
decides the kinds and quantities of foods to be purchased out of the
money allowance. These foods need not be, and usually are not,
exactly the same as the components of the garrison ration. The
organization uses the money allowance to purchase foods required
to prepare the dishes called for by the menu.

h. As the field ration is issued in kind, the Army cook is directly
concerned with its components and substitutive articles which are
published in AR 30-2210.

c. Conditions in the field are such that neither the organization
commander, the mess sergeant, nor the cook knows in advance which |
component and which substitutive articles of the field ration will be
received each day. Therefore, it may become necessary to combine ■
two or more of the component or substitutive articles in order to
make one dish. For example, there might be issued for 1 day fresh
carrots and canned peas, neither in sufficient quantity to serve alone.
They may be cooked together. When the field ration is being issued
daily, an effort should be made to entirely consume the issue each
day in order to avoid holding over any portion.

that the cook keep himself scrupulously clean and in good physical
condition at all times. No one desires to eat food prepared by a cook
who is not clean. A cook who suffers from any ailment (a cold, or
any other sickness) is a possible source of transmission of his ailment
to others. If he does not keep himself clean he may transmit disease

germs to the food. He must wash his hands frequently, and always
after visiting a latrine. He should shave, bathe, and change under-
wear at least daily, and oftener, if necessary, in warm weather. His
outer clothing must be changed as soon as it becomes soiled. Finger-
nails should be kept trimmed short and free from dirt. Regulation
haircuts are comfortable and sanitary and should be procured regu-
larly. Because any illness contracted by a cook or other kitchen per-
sonnel may be readily transmitted to the entire command, they should
immediately report any symptoms of illness, infection, or contagious
disease for medical examination and treatment. The cook must be
careful to avoid coughing or sneezing when this might carry germs
into the food. All cuts, scalds, or burns, no matter how slight, should
be treated immediately to prevent infection.

h. The white caps provided for cooks are not merely for ornament ;
they are to prevent hair, dandruff, or dust from the cook’s hair falling
into the food. White caps must be worn at all times when in the
kitchen and white caps and coats when serving meals.

71. Cooking'g definite plan of work.  ^This plan originates with
the menu. The next step is the assembling or the preparation of the
foods and other items for cooking. The third step is the cooking or
preparation of the food for service. The fourth and final step is the
serving of the food. By having a definite plan of work a cook can
reduce the number of utensils used in preparation of the food and
lessen the dishwashing required. A thoughtless cook often leaves a
trail of unnecessarily soiled utenSils behind him, thereby justly incur-
ring the resentment of the kitchen police. In order to work rapidly
and eflSciently, and to spare himself and others unnecessary steps,
the cook should first thoroughly understand the recipe upon which he
is working. He should read the menu for the day and make definite
plans for cooking and serving all the dishes and foods called for.
Nothing is gained by starting work without a well-laid plan. The
use of a little imagination and anticipation will avoid much unneces-
sary confusion and last-minute rushing. The cook should think of
what he has to do, remember how he did it before, and then try to
do it a little better than the last time. He should also observe how
others do the same things and be alert to adopt any time- or labor-
saving methods which he may see others use. Recipes should always
be consulted as a guide unless one is sure from long experience that
this is not necessary. All ingredients should be accurately weighed
and measured in order that uniformity in quantity, volume, and flavor
may be assured, and that proper and intelligent corrections or adjust-
ments may be made in preparing better dishes or larger or smaller
portions at another time.

THE ARMY COOK


72. Cooking g assembling ingpredients and utensils.  It is
important to liave a place for each utensil and keep it there, clean
and ready for use. Articles to be used, including the kitchen utensils
and the food being prepared, should be assembled within easy reach
of the cook’s table or range, in order to save time and steps. For
example, when preparing cake batter, many steps and much incon-
venience will be saved if the articles required are placed conveniently
at hand upon the table on which the work is to be done. Also, the
fire in the range should be regulated prior to beginning the mixing.
After getting one’s hand into the batter there is no time to collect
articles and regulate the fire, not to mention the inconvenience and
messy operations resulting therefrom. This principle applies to all
dishes prepared in the kitchen.

73. Cooking stoves, ranges, and appliances; directions for
use. g a. Cooks should be thoroughly familiar with their ranges,
steam kettles, and other cooking appliances; know how to operate
them economically; know which parts thereof produce the greatest
heat and under what conditions these appliances may be most effi-
ciently operated. For example, the heat surface of the Army range


No. 5 may be best used as follows :



0 0

0

0

5 4

3

1

0 0

0

0

5a 4a

,3a

2

The No. 1 eye gives off the greatest amount of heat; the No. 2 next.
Nos. 3, 3a, 4, and 4a next; and Nos. 5 and 5a the least. A food to be

boiled should be placed on the No.

1

eye. Should it be desired to

have the food simmer, the utensil must be removed to eye No. 5 or


No. 5a. Tough meat which requires a long, slow process of cooking
may be simmered until tender without fear of burning if placed on
the No. 5 or No. 5a eye. For a moderate heat Nos. 3, 3a, 4, and 4a eyes
can be used to advantage. Stewing requires a gentle heat applied for
a long time.

&amp;. Steam cookers, where available, provide an exceptionally rapid
means of cooking fresh vegetables in quantities. These cookers are
economical of fuel and labor. They produce food of excellent quality,
with a natural tasty flavor, and with very small loss of the nourish-
ing properties contained therein, and, in addition, require little or
no attention and do not allow foods to scorch or bum. Pressure
steam cookers should have an automatic steam cut-off which is con-
trolled by the opening and shutting of the doors, to avoid accidental

scalding of personnel. In using electric ranges or electrical appli-
ances of any kind for cooking, care must be taken to prevent damaging
the heating elements by rough handling or spilled foods. Any food
spilled on this equipment, particularly on the heating elements, should
be cleaned up immediately. Mixing machines, chopping and slicing
machines, grinders, etc., should be well cleaned immediately after
using. AU cutting edges should be kept sharp, and all machinery
well oiled and free from rust, dirt, and grease.

74. Care of ranges and cooking utensils. g a. BeapomihUity of
cook . g ^It is part of the duty of cooking to give the proper care to
ranges, cooking utensils, and kitchen equipment. To do the best
cooking it is essential that this equipment be kept in good condition.
Careful observation of the following instructions will insure kitchen
equipment being in good condition at all times.

h. Ranges, g (1) Army range No. 6 .  The Army range No. 5 is the
type installed in many company kitchens in permanent barracks.

(a) Frequent firing should be made with small amounts of coal
instead of using large amounts with longer intervals between firings.
This will provide an even heat and will result in a smaller con-
sumption of fuel.

(5) Ashes under the firebox should be cleaned out frequently, sev-
eral times a day if necessary. Grate bars will bum out quickly, that
is, become warped and twisted, if ashes under the firebox are allowed
to pile high enough to touch the grate bars.

(c) The oven should be swept out and the top and outer surfaces
of the range and stovepipe rubbed with greasy cloth daily. A greasy
cloth applied daily over the entire range keeps it in better condition
than stove polish applied once a week.

{d) Not less than once each week the range should be thoroughly
cleaned out. To do this remove the top and sweep the top of the
oven, protecting the casing plates. Remove the soot with a scraper
through the flue doors. The mantel should be wiped often with a
damp cloth and, when necessary, washed with soap and water. This
prevents dishes picking up dirt and grease and thus soiling the tables.

(e) An intensely hot fire should never be maintained. Such a
fire is not necessary for good cooking ; on the contrary, it often causes
poor cooking, as foods being cooked on top of the range may become
scorched and those in the oven scorched or overcooked. An intensely
hot fire tends to damage hot water piping and warp the top sections
of the range.

(2) Army field range . g See paragraph 77.

THE ARMY COOK


(3) Electric. g The chief point to consider in using electric ranges
is to avoid damage to the heating elements through rough handling
and spilling of food on the range or heating elements. Any food
spilled should be cleaned off immediately.

(4) Gas. g If foods are spilled on the burners of gas ranges, the
holes will close up, thus cutting oflf heat. The burners should be
kept clean. If the gas range does not appear to be heating well,
the matter should be reported for the attention of a plumber who
may be able to effect improvement by adjusting the air supply to
the burners.

c. Utensils. g (1) General.  Tinned utensils, such as boilers, dip-
pers, meat forks, ladles, skimmers, measures, basting spoons, etc.,
should be cleaned with soap and water, or scoured, if necessary, with
fine scouring soap or wood ashes each time after using. They should
then be scalded and air-dried (sunned if possible) and hung in a
dry place. When tinned utensils become rusted they are unsani-
tary and should be reported to the mess sergeant. Towels should
not be used to dry utensils or dishes if they can be air-dried. Usu-
ally the heat of scalding is sufficient to dry dishes but is not always
sufficient to dry metal utensils, especially such utensils as egg beaters.
If these utensils are placed on a clean stove mantel the heat will dry
them.

(2) Small utensils. g It should be remembered that unclean utensils,
knives, forks, spoons, egg beaters, etc., may impart an unpleasant
flavor to any dish in which they are used; also, that germs are in
the air everywhere, even in the cleanest kitchen. Therefore, every
utensil should be cleaned immediately after use by washing in warm
water and then rinsing in scalding water. This rinsing in scalding
water will kill germs. It is not necessary to clean (wash) the uten-
sils in scalding water; frequently this is bad practice, as scalding
tends to cook the food, especially eggs, on the utensils and makes it
more difficult to remove. Even though utensils have been cleaned
before being hung up or put away they should be rinsed or dipped in
scalding water before being used to kill germs or remove dust which
may be settled on them. Large utensils, as tinned boilers, should be
wiped before using.

(3) Bloch iron haJcepans. g (a) When received.  The black iron
roasting and baking pans supplied to Army messes should be washed
when first received in the mess, in warm soapy water to which a little
washing soda has been added. In the case of new and unused pans,
this is to remove the protective parafiin coating put on by the manu-
facturer.

(5) '"'‘Burning newly received pans. g It should be a routine
practice to “bum in” black iron pans when first received by the mess.
After being washed and dried, the pans should be thinly and evenly
coated with lard or lard substitute. Lard is better, but lard substi-
tute will do. Then the pans are placed in a medium oven (325° to
400° F. g 12 to 16 counts) for 1 hour. This burns in the coating of
lard and gives a smooth, glazed surface, closing up the tiny pores
in the metal and preventing rust. This process is often called “blu-
ing” or “rebluing.”

(c) Periodical rehhdng. g ^Daily use in the mess causes the bumed-in
coating on these pans to wear off, this being indicated by shiny, light-
colored areas. When this occurs the pans should be washed, dried,
and reblued by the method shown in (&amp;) above.

{d) Cleaning. g Black iron pans must be kept thoroughly clean
inside and out. If particles of cooked food or dirt are left on the
outside, they may be transferred to other pans when the pans are
nested. Particles of cooked food or dirt on the inside of a pan will
discolor and impart an unpleasant flavor to any food subsequently
cooked or baked in such a pan. Black iron pans should be scoured
only when necessary to remove dirt as scouring tends to remove the
bluing. Soaking will soften most dirt so that it can be removed by
washing in warm, soapy water. After washing, scald, air-dry (by
heat if possible), and hang separately (not nested).

75. Service of meals. g a. General.  Under the direction of the
mess sergeant, the senior cook on duty is responsible for the service
of meals; that is, that foods are ready at the proper time and placed
on serving dishes in an attractive manner. It is of little use to
exercise great care in cooking a food if it is to be sent to the mess
table presenting an finattractive appearance. On the other hand,
the plainest foods become appealing when served in an attractive
manner. Many men will eat an attractively served plain food which
they would not eat if served in an ordinary manner. Therefore,
every cook should know how to serve attractively.

h. Placing foods on dishes. g (1) Roast meats, as beef, veal, pork,
and lamb, should be of uniform thickness and the slices laid evenly
and neatly on the platter. If gravy is spilled on the edges of the
platter it should be wiped away.

(2) Soft foods, as mush, mashed potatoes, turnips, etc., should be
neatly rounded off, not merely thrown into the dish.

(3) Foods intended to be served hot, as soups, meats, vegetables,
beverages, etc., should be actually hot. Nothing is so disappointing
as lukewarm soup or coffee. Serving dishes should be kept warm.

either by being placed on the range mantel or by other means. Cold
foods should be actually cold, and the cook must use foresight to
chill them sufficiently in advance of serving to accomplish this. Hot
or cold foods should not be placed on the tables until just before the
men are seated ; other foods may be placed earlier.

(4) Pies and cakes should be neatly cut. Pieces of cake should be
neatly arranged on the serving dish without excess loose crumbs.

(5) A little cracked ice added to butter, olives, etc., and to fresh
raw vegetables, as radishes, green onions, lettuce, celery, sliced toma-
toes, etc., before they are sent to the tables makes these foods much
more appetizing.

(6) Fresh fruits, as apples, oranges, pears, grapes, bananas, etc.,
are much more palatable when served chilled, and therefore should be
thoroughly chilled before serving. It is economical and good mess
practice to halve oranges, apples, and pears before serving, to pre-
vent their being carried from the mess hall, and to encourage the con-
sumption of flesh fruits at the table. A saving can be made in this
way, as some men will not eat a whole apple or other fruit ; also the
freshly cut fruit seems to have a greater appeal to the men. Large
bunches of grapes should be cut into smaller bunches.

c. Garnishing. g (1) Gerveral .  One of the best ways to make food
attractive is by garnishing. The effect of color contrast is very
pleasing. For example, a cabbage salad is much more attractive if
a few strips of pimento and green pepper are spread over the top
of the salad. A little paprika sprinkled over mashed potatoes or
potato salad makes them more appetizing and appealing.

(2) Methods . g Following are some methods of garnishing:

(a) Many materials may be used to garnish roast meats. Sprinkle
parsley over the meat and arrange a little around the edge of the
platter. Add a few slices of fresh tomato, or a few french fried
potatoes, or small quantities of green lima beans, diced celery, small
whole boiled onions, green peas, sliced green pepper, or cooked car-
rots and turnips to the serving platter.

(5) When liver and bacon are served, instead of placing all the
bacon in a separate dish, lay a few strips over the liver.

(c) Baked fish, salmon hash, fried oysters, etc., may be garnished
with a few crescent-shaped slices of lemon and may also be garnished
with a little parsley and a few pieces of french fried potatoes.

(d) Soups, stews, and gravies are improved in appearance by
sprinkling a little chopped parsley-over the surface just before serving.

(e) Macaroni and cheese should be sprinkled with paprika.

(/) Garnish spinach with sliced hard-boiled eggs.

{g) Small slices of cheddar cheese with apple pie are much appre-
ciated.

(A) A small quantity of sliced green peppers greatly improves the
flavor of stewed tomatoes, especially if cooked with the tomatoes dur-
ing the last few minutes of cooking.

(i) Many types of pudding can be greatly improved in taste and
appearance by topping with shredded coconut and canned sour red
cherries. Diced pineapple spread over cornstarch or tapioca pudding
and then topped with thinly spread coconut improves appearance and
adds to flavor.

(3) Materials used for garnishing . g Following is a list of some of
the materials which can be used for garnishing. The quantity re-
quired and the cost are small :

Asparagus, in whole spears.

Bacon, fried.

Beans, lima, green, canned or cooked.

Beets, canned or cooked, sliced, diced, or cut into fancy shapes.

76. General instructions. g a. The fundamentals of cooking are
the same in field as in garrison. The chief difference is in the equip-
ment used. The cook must be familiar with the handling of wood
fires and the gasoline burner. Usually too much heat is used with
the gasoline burner and difficulty is experienced with the wood fire
when not accustomed to it. As the field range M1937 can be oper-
ated with wood in case of necessity, the cook should be trained in
the handling of both types of fuel.

&amp;. The menu must be adjusted to accommodate the range to be used
in the field. Part of the meal should be prepared on the top of the
range and part in the oven. This is especially true when either field
range No. 1 or No. 2 is used. The menu should also be planned to ac-
commodate the mess kit. Dishes that require long cooking should be
avoided when the cooking time is limited. Hot cakes should not be
served unless they can be served direct from the griddle to the man.
This requires time. Hot biscuits can be prepared in much less time
and can be served hot from the oven without difficulty.

77. Army field ranges, installing and handling. g a. When
used . g Army field ranges are used by troops in the field when not
equipped with rolling kitchens or other cooking equipment.

h. Classification . g There are three types of field ranges  Army
field range No. 1, Army field range No. 2, and Army gasoline field
range M1937 (par. 78).

is designed to cook for 150 men. It consists essentially of two
parts g ^the oven (No. 41) and the boiling plate. The boiling plate
has three sections (No. 42, and the Alamo attachments, Nos. 42A
and 42B).

(&amp;) On the march, field range No. 1 is ordinarily set up by level-
ing the ground selected and placing the oven (No. 41) and boiling
plate (No. 42) side by side, so that the oven door and the firebox
door will be at the same end. Draw together 42A and 42B and secure
bar lock. Insert 42 (boiling plate) into 42 A and rest 42B snugly
on the angle iron on the rear of the oven. The oven should not be
banked as this would cause the sheet iron along the sides to warp
and finally burn through. Sufficient earth, however, should be
tamped along the sides and closed end to prevent the passage of gases
beneath, but should not extend above the straps along the sides and
under the oven door. (See fig. 19.) If heavy weights, such as large
cans of water, are placed on the boiling plate, lay angle irons across
the plate so that the weight will come on the walls and not on the
center of the plate. This will prevent warping and breaking down
the center of the plate.

{c) When used for 1 day only, a few shovelfuls of earth should be
removed from the place to be covered by the boiling plate ( see fig. 191
to facilitate firing. The best results are obtained by using short

wood, keeping the fire well toward the firing end of the boiling plate ;
or, if using long sticks and branches, pushing them under the boiling
plate as they are consumed.

{d) If the range is to remain in place for several days, it is best to
dig a trench (except in sandy soil) about 18 inches wide by 6 inches
deep at the front and the length of the boiling plate, say 6 feet, slop-
ing upward to about 5 inches in depth at the back end (fig. 20).

Figure 20. g Sketch of range with or without trench.


When installed, the trench should extend under the boiling plate
and about 1 foot under the Alamo attachment (just enough to facili-
tate the draft) and about 6 inches under the oven. When the range
is set up on different ground daily, no difficulty will be experienced
in obtaining the proper temperature in the oven, both for top and
bottom heat. Whenever it remains in the same spot for a longer time
than 1 day, the ground will become dried out and hot, and it may
be necessary to raise the bakepans about 2 inches off the floor of the
oven. This can be done easily by the use of angle irons or other
means, thereby causing an air space under the bakepans. Never use
earth or sand for this purpose as it would cause a hole to burn in
the bottom plate of the oven.

(e) If the range is to be used for a considerable length of time in
one location it should be elevated on a base of bricks or of stones and
clay. In this case no trenches are dug under the range. The ground
is leveled, and a brick floor may be laid if sufficient bricks are avail-
able. Set up the range, temporarily, on the level ground or on the
brick floor, and mark the outline of the range. Then remove the
range and attachments and construct a wall, 3 bricks high and 8
inches wide on the line and on the line between the oven and boiling
plate. Assemble the range on top of the brick walls. Under the
oven place a number of bricks on edge, spaced %-inch apart. These
liold the heat and improve baking. The spaces (fire channel) inside
the brick walls under boiling plate No. 42 and gas chamber under
Alamo attachments Nos. 42A and 42B, and under oven are about

the same as if a trench had been dug as in figure 21. Bank outside
of brick walls at sides and back of range with clean earth.



Figure 21. g Sketch of trenching for range with attachments.


(/) At times it may be necessary to install this range for cooking on
a railroad car or on a wooden floor of a house, shed, etc. To install,
erect a frame 12 inches high, 6 feet long, and 4 feet 6 inches wide ; fill
with sand and set the oven and boiling plate on top of the sand,
anchoring firmly in place. If clay is available, remove all stones,
pebbles, etc. ; add salt water, and sand. This foundation will become
hard and solid and will prevent the burning of the floor.

(2) Description^ installation^ and operation of field range No. g
{a) The Army field range No. 2, complete, weighs about 150 pounds
with utensils, and is designed to cook for 56 men. This range does
not have the Alamo attachments. It consists essentially of two
parts g ^the oven (No. 61) and boiling plate (No. 62).

(b) Field range No. 2 is set up practically the same as No. 1, the
boiling plate being placed in position and the projecting collar being
slipped into the space cut from one end of the oven for that purpose.
The fire is maintained in the same manner as when using the No. 1
range.

(&lt;?) If the range is to remain in place for several days, it is best to
dig a trench, except in sandy soil, about 16 inches wide by 6 inches
deep, and of sufficient length for free fueling, say 5 feet (see fig. 22).
When installed, the trench should extend under the boiling plate and
about 3 inches under the oven g just enough to prevent choking of the
draft. If the flame is allowed to play freely on the bottom of the
oven chamber, it will become too hot for baking and the bottom of
the oven will soon burn out.

c. Remarks on handling ranges. g (1) Ccere of ranges.  (a) A tin
will be found inside the baking chamber which may be used if for
any reason the bottom of the oven is too hot. Should the bottom be
too cold for efficient baking the tin should be removed.

(&amp;) Coal should never be used when wood is obtainable. If pos-
sible, even when coal is used, part of the fuel should be wood, for
the use of coal alone will quickly destroy the range.

(c) In permanent camp, the space above and on the sides of the
oven and stovepipe should be cleaned at least once a week. This also
applies to the boiling plates.

(2) Assemblage for transportation. g ^When breaking camp and
assembling range No. 1 for transportation, draw boiling plate No. 42
forward. Unfasten the bar lock, pull apart, and remove Nos. 42A
and 42B and proceed as indicated below :

(a) To pack the utensils and range No. 1 for transportation, place
the bakepan No. 52 on the ground. Set boiler No. 50 inside of bake-
pan No. 52 and boiler No. 51 inside of boiler No. 50. Place tent
guards inside of boiler No. 51 on bottom. Telescope the four joints
of pipe. Inside of the pipe place two forks, three knives, one steel,
one cleaver, and two folding lanterns. Place joints of pipe contain-
ing utensils inside of boiler No. 51. Place meat chopper in boiler
No. 51 alongside of joints of pipe. Place two basting spoons, one
meat saw, and one skimmer in boiler No. 51, on top of pipe. Cover
with lid No. 51 and then lid No. 50. Place bakepan No. 52 upside
down over lid No. 50. Care should be taken that bakepan handles are
well down to the sides of the pan. Place stovepipe elbow in No. 54.
Place dippers alongside of elbow. Place covers Nos. 54, 53, 49, and
48 on boilers in order named. Place nested boilers Nos. 48, 49, 53, and
54 in rear end of oven. Place bakepan and nested boilers Nos. 50
and 51 in front end of oven. Close the oven door and lock with
damper lock. Place No. 42A on left front corner of oven No. 41, and

flame valve nut down moderately tight.

(6) The flame valve stem should be cleaned frequently. To clean
the flame valve stem, unscrew the packing gland and remove the stem
from the valve body. The packing gland must come out with the
stem. Clean the socket on the side of the flame valve body and be
certain that the end of the small generator tube fits properly in the
socket before the generator yoke screw is tightened. Only moderate
pressure should be used on this screw. Excessive tightening may
distort or rupture the front panel. If a leak occurs at the flame
valve socket, these parts should be reseated with valve grinding
compound.

(7) Clean the filter and insert a new filter disk each time the jet
is cleaned. After inserting a new filter disk in the filter cap be
certain that all dirt particles are removed from the ground joint
before the cap is put in place on the filter body.

(8) Apply graphite grease to the threads of the filter case cap
screw and to the under side of the filter case cap screw gasket.
Pull the cap screw down firmly with the wrench. Avoid excessive
tightening of this screw.

e. Cooking operations. g Suitable temperatures for boiling in the
cook pot and for roasting or baking in the roasting pan at the same
time are produced when the fire unit is operated in the bottom posi-
tion in the cabinet. Pies may be baked in the roasting pan. All
other baking should be done in the baking pan placed inside of the
roasting pan. Always put the cover on the roasting pan when
roasting or baking and keep the top door of the range closed. Fry-
ing in deep fat is done in the roasting pan without the cover, the fire
unit being used in the middle position. For griddle cooking the cover
of the roasting pan is turned over and placed on the brackets in the
top corners of the cabinet, the fire unit being in the top position.

f. Wood burning grate. g The wood burning grate (fig. 34) is pro-
vided with each unit of the range. It is carried, folded, in the bot-
tom of the cabinet when not in use. It is used in the bottom fire
unit position when the range is set up on the ground.

g. General care of range. g (1) Handle the range cabinet and
burner carefully.

(2) Spilled food and grease should be removed promptly. Clean-
ing may be done with a scouring powder and rag or with steel wool
and gasoline.

(3) Do not allow water to enter fuel tank. Invert the fire unit
to remove water from the fuel tank.

(4) Remove rust from the burner slots by pickling for a few
minutes in 50 percent solution of hot muriatic acid.



Figure 34. g Wood burning grate set up for use.


(5) Apply graphite grease to the cook pot cradle rails occasionally.

(6) Keep water in the cook pot whenever it is over the fire.

(7) Protect the filter case ground joint. Avoid dropping objects
on the copper tubing.

(8) Use only the wrenches supplied with the range. Do not use
pliers on any of the nuts.

A. Troubles and their treatment. g (1) A leak at the filter case
ground joint, indicated by a yellow flame at the point of leakage, may
be caused by an injured ground joint surface or by a loose cap screw.

(2) Tighten a loose screw, though not excessively. Tapping the
filter case cap right over a leak may stop a small leak. Regrinding
will be necessary when the ground joint surfaces have been injured.
Grind as little as possible.

(3) Much trouble is caused by tightening -filter case cap scr&amp;vo too
tight. If the ground joint surfaces are clean, moderate tightening
is sufficient.

(4) A leak at the flame valve socket may be caused by dirt in the
socket, or by improper placing of the flame valve when the generator
yoke is tightened. Be very careful to put the generator tube into this
socket just right before the yoke screw is tightened. An injured
socket joint may be repaired by grinding in with valve grinding
compound.

(5) Excessive tightening of the generator yoke screw may fracture
the front panel. Very moderate pressure will make this joint tight.

(6) Unions on the tubing fittings should be set up moderately tight.

(7) A yellow flame may be caused by dirt at the point of the flame
valve stem. This may be removed by turning the valve stem back and
forth while the flame is in operation.

(8) If the flame valve jet is not cleaned frequently the opening will
be reduced by dirt. This condition may be remedied by closing the
flame valve tight and reopening. Ream a dirty jet at the first chance.

(9) A dirty filter disk reduces the passage of fuel through the disk,
and is indicated by a weak flame. Replace the dirty filter disk.

(10) If the passages in the filter case body and in the generator tubes
are allowed to go too long without cleaning they will choke and stop
the flame.

(11) These passages are very difficult to clean if they are allowed to
choke tight. Cleaning of these passages about twice a week will
prevent trouble.

i. Water heater . g The carrying case for the spare fire unit with each
set of range units is designed to be used as a water heater (fig. 35).
Two 24-gallon cans may be placed on this heater. The shield, for use
on the can being heated, is carried inside of one of the cans. It is
placed around the can being heated to hold the heat to the wall of
the can.

79. Installation of Army field range No. 1 in baggage car. g

fl. To install the field range No. 1 in a baggage car as part of an
emergency kitchen equipment when kitchen cars are not available,
construct a box 6 feet 8 inches long by 5 feet 6 inches wide and
about 12 inches deep (inside measurements), with bottom, using
1Y2- or 2-inch material as available. Line the sides, ends, bottom,
and top edge of the box with galvanized iron or zinc. Place box in
car on 2 by 4’s running lengthwise on one side of the car about 2
feet from the side, giving a 4-inch air space between bottom of box
and floor of car. Fill box with dirt to about 2 inches of the top.
Place a brick flush with top of dirt at each of the four corners
where the range will set. Place range in box, front and oven end
close up against end of box, and deep enough in the box so that when
oven door is opened it will lie flat on the edge of box. Place boiling
plate in box, the end resting on top of angle iron on rear of range.
Place brick under each front corner of boiling plate flush with top
of the dirt. The Alamo attachments are not used when range No. 1
is installed in the above manner.

b. Fasten range and boiling plate firmly to box by means of strap
iron, or two or three strands of telephone or telegraph wires at points
shown in figure 39. Fill space between range, boiling plate and side
of box with soft mud to prevent heat from escaping. Three and
even four field ranges may be installed in a car.

c. Remove one of the top ventilating windows from car; tack tent
guards, furnished with each range, over the opening, one on the out-
side of the car and one on the inside. Carry stovepipe up and out
through the opening. End of pipe should extend about 6 inches out-
side of the opening. Elbow should be placed on end of pipe facing
up and wired firmly to car. Wire stovepipe firmly to both sides of
car.

d. Box can be held firmly in position on floor of car by nailing
2 by 4 strips around sides and ends of box. This is important and
must not be neglected.

e. The following additional equipment to that supplied with each
range is necessary: two galvanized iron water cans, two galvanized
iron buckets, one stovepipe elbow, and 100 feet of wire.

g. If the equipment is to be set up in a freight car, a hole would
have to be cut in the top of the car for the stovepipe, using tent guards
as explained in c above, to cover this opening.

A. The commanding officer of troops on a train carrying a kitchen
car in which a field range has been installed, will issue such orders
as may be necessary to insure watchful attention being given the
range and the fire in the range, continuously by day or night.

i. Six bricks, placed three to the side, as shown in figure 39 will serve
to hold the range securely in position while the car is in motion.

j. A freight car sliould not be used unless absolutely necessary as
the Government will be compelled to pay for repairs necessary to
replace the car in proper condition.



80. Installation and use of Army field range M1937 on troop
trains. g a. The Association of American Railroads considers that
that the Army field range M1937 can be safely used for cooking oit
troop trains when installed and operated in accordance with tha
instructions below. j

h. All range cabinets, securely latched together as a battery, will;
be placed against the side wall of a baggage car, and secured by stay
chains and wooden blocks as indicated in figure 40. The woodeo
blocks will be secured with 16-penny nails or with lag screws, which-
ever will result in the least damage to the car floor. The large hook
on the outer end of the chain will be run through a link of the
chain and will serve as a pull bar against the outer ends of the
wooden blocks. In event the car furnished has a wooden interior,
the range set will be placed 2 inches from the side of the car.

c. The installation of the range will be made under the super-
vision of a commissioned officer.

d. One 5-gallon gasoline safety-filling can is furnished as standard
equipment with each range set. Only one such can of gasoline will
be carried in a car, except where the number of range cabinets in-
stalled exceeds three, in which event two such cans of gasoline may
be carried. Gasoline cans will be placed in individual wood con-
tainers secured to the car floor as indicated in figure 41. The wooden
containers will be as far removed from the ranges as is practically
possible.



e. One 1-quart carbon tetrachloride fire extinguisher and one
bucket of sand will be provided in the car for each range set of three
cabinets.

f. Since the carrying in the car of gasoline in excess of the quantity
authorized in paragraph d above is prohibited, arrangements will be
made for replenishing the safety cans en route.

ff. Fire units will be removed to the other end of the car or out-
side of the car, if practicable, for refueling. In no event will units
he refueled while there is any fire in the car or while the car is in
motion. The work of refueling fire units will be supervised by a
commissioned officer.

A. The installation and use of equipment normally provided for
heating water in the field is prohibited on troop trains. The fire unit

normally used for heating water may be carried on troop trains as a
spare, provided it is securely fastened to the floor of the car.

i. In order to decrease the fire hazard when ranges are installed
in railroad cars with wooden floors, a metal sheet will be placed under
the cabinets. This sheet will cover the entire floor area occupied by
the range and should extend at least 4 inches beyond the front edge
of the cabinets. Twenty-gage metal or heavier is suitable for the
purpose.

81. Improvised ice box. g a. An ice box is always a great con-
venience. during warm weather and an improvised one may be con-
structed by simply setting a drygoods box inside of a larger one,
preparing the necessary lids, and filling the space between the two
boxes (4 to 8 inches) with sawdust, gunny sacks, leaves, grass, hay,
straw, or any available nonconducting material. Or even better,
use a single box set in the ground and packed around with materials
as noted above or with solid dirt.

h. To provide a simple ice box for the field, sink a packing box of
suitable size into the ground and prepare a close-fitting cover in
two parts, for convenience in handling. It is well to surround the
box with heavy paper or with packed straw or grass to prevent dirt
from falling in through the cracks. To provide drainage, bore
several holes in the bottom of the box, and if practicable, put a
quantity of stone or gravel in the bottom of the pit before installing
the box. If facilities are at hand, provide a double box (fig. 42) . It
will be cleaner and on account of the double top the ice will last
longer.

82. Garbage. g a. Source .  Garbage should accumulate only from
uneaten food on the men’s mess kits or plates and unavoidable
kitchen waste. Both of these sources should be held to a minimum.

Food left on serving platters, in cooking utensils, etc., should be
carefully conserved. No edible food should ever go into the garbage
if it can possibly be avoided.



b. Disposal . g (1) Whenever facilities are not provided for dis-
posing of the kitchen waste, it becomes necessary to dig a slop pit.
Open slop pits should be avoided as they attract flies and spread
infection. It is necessary, in a camp of other than temporary dura-
tion, to strain all dishwater and liquid garbage through a box sieve
suitably placed over a pit and burn all solid matter in the range
or incinerator. To darken the pit and keep it free from flies, make
a board top, tamp edges with dirt, and provide a detachable box
sieve with cover (fig. 43). The pit should generally be about 2^^

feet wide, 5 feet long, and 4 feet deep when dug in clay, and should
be filled about half full with large rocks. In more permeable soil
the dimensions may be somewhat reduced.

(2) To build a company incinerator, dig two trenches 10 feet
long and 10 or 12 inches wide, bisecting each other. At the point of
bisection have the trenches 30 inches deep, gradually shallowing from
this point to the ends. Fill with rocks until about 18 inches deep at



center. Over the place of bisection place four boards to support an
ordinary sugar or flour barrel. Around the barrel pile sods of earth
packed tightly up to the top. Make a fire in the trench under the
barrel, which, upon being burned out, leaves a hard cone (fig. 44).
According to the direction of the wind, leave one trench open and
plug the other three openings near the cone with boards, turf, or
loose soil. This gives a draft of air through the open trench and
up through the cone, which acts as a flue. If the soil is full of clay
the cone is easily made. If not, it can be done by using sods.

(3) All the garbage produced by a large organization kitchen can
be easily disposed of by this means. At the end of each day the
ashes and tin cans should be raked out of the fireplace and a fresh
fire started in the morning. The fire is kept up by dropping fuel
material down the cone, and garbage is fed to it in the same manner.
The incinerator is also very satisfactory for disposing of waste water.

83. Arrangement. g a. These recipes do not include all the
recipes found in other cookbooks due to the fact that all recipes are
not suitable for an Army mess. However, a good cook will always
be on the alert to discover additional recipes from commercial cook-
books and other sources of dishes which are suitable for an Army
mess. In this manual all recipes are based on service for 100 men.
The quantity required for a greater or smaller number of men can
be easily figured by changing the amount of each ingredient pro-
portionally. For convenience of use and ease in finding, the recipes
have been indexed and arranged in groups as follows :

( 1 ) Breakfast dishes.

(2) Soups.

(3) Meat dishes (includes poultry, game, and omelets).

(4) Gravies and sauces.

(5) Fish and seafood dishes.

(6) Vegetable dishes.

(7) Desserts.

(8) Sweet-dough products.

(9) Hot breads.

(10) Rolls.

(11) Salads and dressings.

(12) Beverages.

h. In each group recipes are arranged in alphabetical order. The
index should be used as a reminder of the various ways in which

food can be prepared and also of the many varieties of foods and
dishes which are usable in a mess.

84. Variation. g The opinions of experienced cooks often vary as
to the exact quantities of food required to prepare various dishes
for a given number of men. This variation of opinions is due to
individual taste or based upon their knowledge of the preference
of their particular messes. The recipes in this manual are designed
to be a guide for those who do not definitely know the exact quanti-
ties required, and these recipes will produce satisfactory results if
accurately followed. The quantities shown for 100 men may be
successfully modified by an experienced cook and should be so modi-
fied by experience where local conditions justify or demand this. The
quantity of food consumed by a mess will vary according to the char-
acter of duty performed, the number of absentees, the season of the
year, and many other causes, and the same mess will require notice-
ably varying quantities, dependent upon varying conditions of serv-
ice. Inexperienced cooks should follow the recipes contained herein ;
experienced cooks may successfully deviate from the recipes under
certain conditions, and all cooks should know by experience the proper
quantities of food required to satisfy their own messes. This knowl-
edge is acquired by the constant study of these and other recipes
and of the preference of the messes which they serve, as evidenced
by their consumption or rejection of the dishes offered.

8 pounds onions, chopped

Cut the beef into pieces weighing about 5 pounds each. Wipe with
a damp cloth. Sear until well browned on all sides. Season. Place
in a large dutch oven or camp kettle or any covei’ed utensil. A heavy
utensil is best. Add the chopped onions and vinegar. If the meat
is well covered with fat, basting is not necessary. If the beef is lack-
ing in fat, it is a good practice to lard with strips of fat or place a
layer of fat on top. About 2 pounds of fat pork or bacon are required
for this. This added fat improves the flavor, melts, and bastes the
meat. Cook covered, in a slow oven (200°-250° F.) or on top of stove
until tender. This will require 2 to 5 hours, dej^jending on tenderness
of beef used. The beef should be turned three or four times while
cooking. When done, remove from utensil and slice. The pot roast
may be served in either of two ways: Make a thick gravy in the

utensil in which the beef was roasted and pour this gravy over the
sliced beef on platters, or make a gravy of the desired thickness and
serve separately,

50. Beef, braised, with vegetables


40 pounds beef, chuck roast ( not
boned )

8 pounds carrots, sliced
8 pounds onions, sliced
8 pounds celery, cut in bits


8 pounds turnips, sliced

Salt and pepper to taste


Cut the meat into pieces weighing about 5 pounds each, wipe it
with damp cheesecloth, and roll in flour. Place vegetables in suffi-
cient salted cold water to barely cover them and boil until soft, then
rub them through a colander or coarse strainer. Sear the meat on
all sides. After the meat is seared, transfer it to a kettle or kettles.

THE ARMY COOK


If the beef is lean (lacking in fat), it is well to cut about 2 pounds
of fat pork into strips, or use sliced bacon, and lay on top of the beef.
This keeps the roast basted. Pour the vegetables and their liquid
over the meat, together with any preferred seasoning. Cover tightly
and let it simmer slowly for 4 or 5 hours, turning twice. After the
meat is cooked, remove from kettle. Thicken the liquid remaining in
the kettle by adding flour, and pour it over the meat.

51. Beef, corned

60 pounds corned beef

Wash the meat in warm water and, if it has been in brine until
too salty, cover it with cold water and bring slowly to a boil. Drain
off the water, cover again with fresh cold water, and reheat. As soon
as the liquid bubbles, reduce the heat, add a few whole peppers, and
continue cooking slowly (always below the boiling point) for 2 or
3 hours, according to quality and quantity of beef, until the meat is
tender. Keep the meat closely covered during the cooking process,
and turn it when partly done, adding hot water from time to time
so as to keep it completely covered. Carrots, parsnips, and potatoes
may be added during the cooking process, if desired.

52. ‘Beef, creamed

20 pounds coarse ground beef 8 cans milk, evaporated

1 pound lard or butter 2 gallons beef stock or water

2 pounds flour

Braise the meat. Make a gravy in a separate pan as follows : Melt
the lard, add the flour, stirring constantly until thoroughly blended
and browned. Stir in the liquid, a little at first, then enough to thin
the mixture, and finally the remainder. Season to taste. Pour the
gravy over the ground meat and simmer until the meat is tender.

53. Beef, curry of

45 pounds beef, fresh 2 ounces curry powder

1 pound flour Salt and pepper to taste

Cut the beef into 1-inch cubes and place in a bakepan. Cover with
cold beef stock or water and season to taste with curry powder
(usually about 2 ounces of curry powder is used). Cook in a slow
oven (200°-250® F, g 18 to 20 counts) about 3 hours. When nearly
done thicken slightly with a flour batter. Serve hot.

Slice the meat and serve on a platter with hot gravy poured over it.
Serve with dumplings.

63. Beef, roast

55 pounds beef, fresh

This recipe is for cooking the tender cuts of beef. The less tender
cuts should be braised, if a roast is desired.

Cut the beef into pieces about 5 pounds each and wipe with a damp
cloth. Sear until all sides are well browned. If the beef is lean
(lacking in fat) , it is well to lard it with about 2 pounds of fat pork
cut into strips, or lay these strips over the top. Sliced bacon may be
used. This improves flavor and bastes the beef while roasting. Place
in pan with fat side up. Boast in moderate oven (325* F. g 16
counts) for about 1% hours (about 20-22 minutes per pound per
piece). If in larger pieces than 5 pounds, more time is required;
however, for 5-pound pieces the time of 1 % hours after searing should

not be greatly exceeded as roasting longer than this, or allowing the
roast to remain in the oven after it is done, tends to make the finished
roast dry and hard. Roasting should be started so that the roast will
be finished shortly before time to serve; for example, a roast for
dinner started about 9:30 AM will be ready to carve at 11:30 AM.
When done, carve into thin slices, across the grain. Remove all
chunks of fat, bones, and tendons, and render for soup stock. Serve
hot with gravy made from the roast drippings. (See recipe 122.)

Fowls over 6 months old should not be fried. Eemove pin feathers
by singeing over hot blaze. Divide each chicken into about 10 pieces
(natural divisions). Fry in shallow fat, or in deep fat. If fried in
deep fat, dip each piece in the beaten eggs and then in the cracker
meal. If the mixture does not adhere to the pieces sufficiently, repeat
the operation. Drain well in a colander and keep hot until served.
In case older chickens are used, which are large and possibly tough,
fried pieces should be placed in a bakepan with about 2 inches of
water, the pan covered, and placed in a slow oven to steam for about
40 minutes.

To make the dressing, moisten the bread crumbs with water, mix with
onions and giblets, and season with pepper and saft, sage, thyme, or
other spices. The bread may be soaked in oyster liquor and oysters
added to the dressing. Celery, currants, or raisins may be used in-
stead of onions. Lemon juice or nuts may be added. This dressing
may be used with any fowl or fish. Stuff the chicken well with dress-
ing. Sew up with strong thread and tie wings down to the body.
Make a batter with the flour and fat, season with salt and pepper,
and rub the chicken with it before placing in oven. Koast in a slow
oven (200®-250° F. g 18 to 20 counts). After the chicken has been
in the oven about 20 minutes, add a little hot water and baste every
15 minutes until done. This generally requires about 2^ hours,
depending upon the quality of the fowl. Last few minutes of cook-
ing should be at a high heat to brown the outside of the chicken.

86. Ham, simmered

50 pounds ham, smoked

Wash and scape the ham. If the ham is very salty, let soak for
several hours in fresh water. Then change the water. The water in
which hams are cooked should never be allowed to reach the boiling
point. Place hams in near-boiling water (enough to cover) and sim-
mer until the hams are properly cooked. This process requires about
20 minutes to the pound. If two or more hams are simmered in the
same vessel, the time of cooking should be computed on the largest
ham. Skim all the impurities from the water as they arise. Let the
hams cool in the water in which they are cooked.

Mold, if present, may be removed from ham by wiping with a clean
cloth dampened with vinegar. The water in which the ham was cooked
may be used to cook cabbage, spinach, etc.

Cut the mutton into 1-inch cubes. Add sufficient beef stock or cold
water to just cover the mutton, and allow to simmer slowly for \y^
hours or until the mutton is done. Add vegetables and cook until
done. Season to taste with pepper and salt and thicken slightly with
a flour batter. Serve hot with or without dumplings (recipe 80). If
dumplings are added, use only 20 pounds of mutton and 30 pounds of
potatoes.

96. Omelet, plain

150 eggs 2 pounds drippings or fat

8 cans milk, evaporated, diluted with 8 Salt and pepper to taste

pints water ; or 8 quarts fresh milk

Mix the eggs and milk, season, and whip well. Put drippings or
other fat into the bakepan, and when the fat begins to smoke pour in
the mixture, not more than 3 inches deep, and bake in a medium oven.

97. Omelet, cheese

Same as for plain omelet except that 3 pounds of cheese, chopped
very fine, are added before cooking.

98. Omelet, ham

Same as for plain omelet except that 3 pounds of finely chopped
cooked ham are added before cooking.

99. Omelet, tomato

Prepare in the same manner as the plain omelet, substituting 8
small cans of tomatoes for the 8 pints of water, or for 4 quarts of
fresh milk.

100. Pork chops

60 pounds pork loin

Cut into chops about one-half inch thick and weighing from 3 to 5
ounces each. Fry in a bakepan without added fat until seared, then
cover pan until the chops are done. Use a high heat until chops are
seared, then finish at lower temperature as high heat after searing
will make the chops dry and hard. They may be breaded in flour
or corn meal and fried with added fat. Serve with gravy made from
the drippings.

101. Pork cutlets

50 pounds pork cutlets 2 pounds fat

2 pounds flour

Dredge each cutlet with flour and fry in shallow fat. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Serve hot with gravy made from the
frying. Dipping in egg batter before flouring improves the product.


102. Pork, roast


50 pounds pork, shoulder, butt, or loin, Salt and pepper to taste
or 40 pounds fresh ham

Wipe the roast with damp cloth and cut into pieces weighing about
5 pounds each. Place in an uncovered roaster without water and rub
with salt and pepper. Roast in a moderate oven (325°-350® F. g 12 to
16 counts). Cook until roast is well done, allowing 30 to 35 minutes
per pound for a 3- to 4-pound roast.

103. Sausage, bologna, fried

30 pounds bologna sausage 12 eggs

2 cans milk, evaporated, diluted with 1 8 pounds fat
quart water, or 2 quarts fresh milk

Remove sausage casing and slice about one-half inch thick and dip
in batter made by beating eggs and adding milk. Fry in deep fat.
Serve hot. Bologna sausage may also be served cold with salad, or
made into sandwiches.


104. Sausage, pork

(32 lb. mixture)


20 pounds pork, lean
12 pounds beef, lean
4 ounces salt
3 ounces i&gt;epper, black


% ounce coriander
% ounce sage
% pint vinegar
1 clove garlic


Dice the pork in 1^-inch squares. Grind the beef and mix with the
pork, add all the seasoning and mix well, then grind again. The
more thoroughly the sausage is mixed, the better it will be. Mold
into patties each about 4 ounces and fry without the addition of fat.
Serve hot. If too dry, add water. If desired, 10 pounds of dry
bread or cracker crumbs or corn meal may be ground in, but this does
not improve the product.


105. Sausage, pork, in blankets


30 pounds link sausages 3 pounds flour

2 eggs, beaten 1% ounces salt

2 pounds lard


Make a dough of the flour, lard, and salt and roll out as for pie
crust. Inclose 1 or 2 sausage links in a piece of dough, wash with the
egg, and bake until a delicate brown.

106. Sausage, frankfurter


35 pounds frankfurter sausage

Place sausage in boiling water, but do not allow it to boil thereafter,
as this causes the skins to crack, rendering them unsightly and injur-
ing the flavor. Long cooking also injures the quality ; therefore, the
sausage should not be put into the water more than 15 minutes before
serving. Serve hot.

107. Sausage, frankfurter, in blankets

Prepare in the same manner as pork sausage.

108. Short ribs of beef

75 pounds short ribs 1 pound fat

3 pounds onions, chopped 2 tal)lespoonfuls pepper

3 pounds carrots 6 tablespoonfuls salt

6 cans tomatoes (No. 3 cans)

Melt the fat in bakepan. Add onions and short ribs, cut into pieces
containing 1 or 2 ribs, and brown well. Add tomatoes, carrots, and
seasoning, and enough water to cover all ingredients. Cover the pan
and cook slowly in moderate oven (250°-326° F. g 16 to 18 counts) for
3 hours or until done. Serve hot.

Note. g If the quantity of carcass beef on hand does not provide sufficient short
ribs and it is not desired to purchase any as a wholesaie market cut, any short-
age can be made up by using chuck meat.


109. Southern creoles

70 pork hocks, fresh 2 quarts tomato catsup

4 cans tomatoes (No. 3 cans) 3 ounces pickling spices

Simmer hocks for 30 minutes, then pour off the water and add the
tomatoes, catsup, and spices, salt, pepper. Bake until the meat is
done. Pour the cooking mixture as a sauce over the hocks when
served. Either strain the sauce to take out the pickling spices or cook
spices in a small bag so that they may be removed before serving.
Serve hot.

110. Spaghetti, Italian style


10 pounds meat, diced, beef preferred
(fresh or left over)

1 pint cooking oil or bacon drippings

Heat the oil or fat and brown the onions and garlic. Add meat, and
brown. Add tomatoes and catsup. Salt and pepper to taste. Sim-
mer until sauce begins to thicken and add paprika to give bright red
color. Put spaghetti in boiling salted water and boil 20 minutes or
until done. Drain spaghetti and run enough cold water over it to
make it firm and keep from becoming a doughy mass but do not chill.
Pour the hot sauce over it and serve. Grated cheese may be sprinkled
on top.

111. Spareribs

55 pounds spareribs

Cut the spareribs into pieces of 2 or 3 ribs each. There are two
principal methods of cooking spareribs :

With sauerkraut . g Place the spareribs on a rack in a bakepan and
sear about 15 minutes or until nicely browned in a hot oven (450°-
500° F. g 8 counts). Remove spareribs and rack and pour off drip-
pings but save these. Place 4 No. 10 cans, or 16 No. 2)4 cans, or 4
gallons of fresh sauerkraut in the same bakepan and pour the drip-
pings from the searing over the sauerkraut. Place the seared spare-
ribs on top of the sauerkraut, season highly by sprinkling with pepper,
salt, and a little ground sage, and bake in a slow oven (200°-250° F. g
18 to 20 counts) for 1 hour. If the spareribs become hard and dry,
this can be corrected by covering the pan for the last 15 to 30 minutes
of baking and the steam will soften them. Any excess liquid makes
excellent soup stock.

'With cabbage . g Drop the spareribs into boiling water, then simmer
for 30 minutes. Bring the Avater to a boil again, drop in 50 pounds
of cabbage, and boil until cabbage is tender (about 20 minutes).

112. Stew, chop suey

30 i)ounds meat (pork, beef, or veal) cut 1 pint barbecue sauce (recipe 126) or
in strips % inch thick and 1 inch long pint molasses

17 pounds onions, sliced 2 gallons beef stock

4 pounds celery, sliced crosswise 8 pounds rice

Brown the meat, add the stock, and simmer until meat is tender.
Add onions, celery, and seasoning and cook 30 minutes before serving.
This should be served with 8 pounds of cooked rice.

113. Stew, pan

35 pounds beef, cooked and diced 3 quarts beef stock

20 pounds potatoes, boiled and diced Salt and pepper to taste
4 pounds onions, chopped

Miy the beef, potatoes, and onions and season. Put in a well-
greased bakepan, spreading to a depth of about 3 inches and add suf-
ficient beef stock to cover the mixture. Bake in medium oven until
nicely browned. It should not be as watery as the ordinary stew.
All left-over potatoes, except fried, may be utilized in this stew.
Left-over parts of roasts and gravy may be used. Serve hot.


114. Stew el rancho


80 pounds meat (beef, pork, or veal),
fresh, without bone and with but
little fat, cut in about 1%-lnch
cubes

15 pounds potatoes

2 cans tomatoes (No. 3 cans) or 10
pounds fresh tomatoes


5 pounds carrots, quartered lengthwise
7 pounds turnips, sliced across grain
7 pounds cabbage, cut in eighths
5 pounds onions, small whole
2 ounces chill powder


Place the meat, turnips, carrots, and tomatoes in a large pan. Sim-
mer until the meat is tender and then add the remaining vegetables.
Season with salt and chili powder, and simmer until vegetables are
done. All ingredients should be thoroughly cooked but not broken
into pieces. The liquid should cover all the solids by about an inch.
The stew is improved by a bunch of parsley chopped fine and added
just before serving; a few sprigs of parsley may be used for garnish-
ing. Serve hot with the vegetables whole, if possible. Any kind of
fresh meat and any vegetables may be used in this stew.


115. Stew, Irish


30 pounds beef, fresh, or left-over beef 1 ijound flour
20 pounds potatoes, peeled 2 gallons beef stock

5 pounds onions

Select cuts of beef suitable for stewing from less tender cuts and
dice into ^-inch cubes or smaller, cutting all about the same size.
Cook at a simmering temperature until nearly tender. Dice the po-
tatoes into 1-inch cubes, chop the onions, and add both to the meat.
Add beef stock or water to cover the ingredients in the pan about 1
inch. Season to taste with salt and pepper and thicken with batter
made of flour. Simmer until the vegetables are thoroughly done.
This stew is improved by the addition of 3 pounds of diced carrots
or turnips or three No. 3 cans tomatoes. To make a potpie out of this,
cover with a biscuit dough and bake in a medium oven (325°g 400° F.
12 to 16 counts). To improve the appearance, the dough may be
washed with a beaten egg, which will give a golden brown color.
Serve hot.-

116. Tamales

20 pounds cooked meat scraps 3 ounces salt

114 poimds corn meal 2 ounces chill powder

8 pounds flour 1 clove garlic, chopped flne

5 pounds mashed potatoes 1 quart beef stock

Run the meat through a chopper. Add salt, pepper, garlic, and
chili powder, and mix well. Add the beef stock. Mix the corn meal,
flour, and potatoes with enough water to make a stiff dough. Roll out
this dough % inch thick, using flour for dusting. Cut the dough in
long strips about 2^ inches wide. Place on each strip enough meat
to form a core about ^ inch in diameter. Fold the sides of the strip
together and seal by moistening the edges with water and press-
ing together. Cut the rolled strips into pieces about 5 inches long.
Fresh meat may be used in making tamales, in which case the fat is
cut off and the meat is cut into %-inch cubes and cooked until well
done in a small amount of fat. Then proceed as outlined above. Fry
the tamales in deep fat. Serve hot.


117. Turkey, roast

Prepare in the same manner as roast chicken, substituting 70 pounds
of turkey, undrawn.

118. Veal cutlets

50 pounds veal 1 pound flour

12 to 16 counts). The above recipe may be improved by substituting
milk for water.

GRAVIES AND SAUCES

121. Flour batter (for thickening liquids)

Flour Water

The quantity of flour used will depend upon the quantity of liquid
to be thickened and the thickness desired. One quart of water, mixed
with 1 pound of flour will thicken to gravy consistency about 2)4
gallons of liquid. The thickness of the liquid will also depend upon
the length of boiling, after putting in the batter, as long boiling
evaporates more of the moisture and results in thicker liquid. Care
must be used in mixing the batter with the liquid as constant stirring
is necessary to prevent lumping.

122. Gravy, brown

1 quart fat 2 gallons w.iter

2 pounds fionr

The gravy should be made in the pan used in roasting the meat, as
only by this method can all the extractives lost from the meat be
retained in the gravy. Brown gravy is made from the drippings
of roasted meat or fowl and the frying of pork. One quart of fat
will make 2 gallons of gravy. Take the fat in the roasting pan after
the meat or fowl has been removed, heat to the smoking point, and
add enough flour to absorb the hot fat, stirring constantly to prevent
burning and lumping. When the flour is brown, add cold water
(about 1 gallon to the pound of flour used) and continue cooking and
stirring until the gravy is smooth and of the desired thickness or con-
sistency. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot. Brown gravy may
also be made from stock by the same procedure, except that 2 quarts
of stock are used instead of 1 quart of drippings; however, gravy
made from stock is not nearly as palatable as that made from roast
drippings.

123. Gravy, cream

8 cans milk, evaporated, diluted with 1 quart fat
8 pints water, or 1% pounds powdered 2 pounds flour
skim milk dissolved in 7 % quarts
water, or 2 gallons fresh milk

Cream gravy is made from the fryings of beef or fowl. Follow the
same procedure as in making brown gravy, except that the flour is
not browned and milk is used instead of water.

124. Gravy, glblet

This should be made only when poultry is roasted or fried. Chop
the cooked gizzards, hearts, and livers of the fowls and add to a
cream gravy made from the drippings.

125* Gravy, stock

10 quarts stock 2 gallons water

2 pounds flour


Heat the stock to the boiling point and sift in the flour slowly,
stirring constantly. If a brown gravy is desired, continue cooking
until the flour is browned, then add the water and continue cooking
and stirring until of the desired thickness, but if white gravy is de-
sired do not brown the flour. Season with salt and pepper. Serve
hot. This gravy should be made only when drippings or frying are
not available.

126. Sauce, barbecue


1 gallon catsup

1 gallon vinegar

2 to 3 cups dry mustard
2 tablespoons red pepper


3 tablespoonfuls black pepper
% cup chili powder
2 medium size pieces garlic
% cup salt


Bring to boil and let boil 2 hours or until it begins to thicken. Mix
well and keep it stirred.


127. Sauce, cranberry

17 quarts cranberries 6 pounds sugar

Wash and stem the berries, put in a boiler, and cover with about 1
inch of cold water. Cover tightly and boil until berries break to
pieces and cover themselves with their juice. Eemove the lid and
simmer for 30 minutes. If a sauce free of skins is desired, rub through
a colander. Then pour into an earthen or wooden vessel and cool.
Serve cold with chicken, turkey, or other kinds of meat.


128. Sauce, cream, for codfish


2 pounds fat 1 pound onions, minced

7 cans milk, evaporated, or 23 ounces 10 eggs, hard-boiled, minced
powdered skim milk dissolved in 5% 1 pound pickles, minced
pints water


Thicken 1 gallon of boiling water with a flour batter and season
with pepper and salt. Bring to a boil and add the fat, milk, onions,
eggs, and pickles; whip well and spread over the fish on the platter
The sauce may be improved by the addition of 6 or more hard-boiled
eggs, chopped fine.

In cold weather the soaking may be overnight, in which case the
2-hour simmering will not be necessary. In hot weather the beans
may sour if soaked when a cool temperature cannot be obtained.
When this condition is met with, beans may be baked as follows :

Wash the beans in cold water, drain, and place in cold water; sim-
mer 45 minutes, drain, and put beans in bakepan. Mix in chopped
onion and tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Place sliced

THE ARMY COOK


For serving as an additional vegetable use one-half of this recipe.

Open the cans and empty into bakepans or, if they cannot be
heated in the oven, place in boilers. They may be served after simply
heating (requiring about 15 minutes) but will be improved by adding
2 bottles or one-half of a No. 10 can of catsup, also about 12 whole
onions, % gallon of pickles, 2 or 3 pounds of sliced or cut bacon,
2 quarts of molasses, and 8 ounces of prepared (wet) mustard.
The quantities of these additional ingredients may be varied accord-
ing to what is on hand. The bacon should be laid on top of the
beans, but onions, pickles, molasses, and mustard should be mixed
through them. If bacon and onions are added, it is necessary to
bake or cook the beans at least 30 minutes. If this is done the
temperature should be kept below the boiling point if in a boiler,
and if in an oven at slow heat (200°-250® F. g 18 to 20 counts).

Note. g In the absence of any other means of cookinsr, canned beans (as
well as any other canned food) may be heated for serving by immersing the
cans for about 15 minutes in hot or boiling water. The heat causes an internal
expansion which may cause the hot contents to spurt out when the can is
opened after removing, from the hot water, and the cook who opens the cans
must use care to avoid being scalded. If it is desired to prevent contamina-
tion of the water in which the unopened cans are heated, the labels should be
removed and the cans washed clean before immersing.

146. Beans, dry, simmered

20 pounds beans, dry 4 pounds bacon, sliced, or ham hocks,

or salt pork

For serving as an additional vegetable, use one-half of this recipe.

Wash the beans thoroughly, place in a boiler with about 4 gallons
of cold water and bring to a boil, then skim and simmer for 4 hours
or until done. After they have simmered about 2 hours, add the
meat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Water added during
cooking should be boiling hot. Serve hot.

147. Beans, lima, green or soaked, canned

4 cans lima beans, green or soaked 2 pounds bacon, sliced, or ham hocks,

(No. 10 cans) or 20 cans (No. 2 cans) or salt pork

If the meat is not added, the beans can be heated for serving in
about 15 minutes. If the meat is added, open the cans, add the meat,
and simmer for about 1 hour.

until tender. Serve hot.

149. Beans, string or snap, canned

4 cans beans, string (or snap) (No. 3 pounds bacon, sliced
10 cans) or 20 cans beans (No. 2
cans)

Empty the cans into a bakepan or boiler, add the bacon, and sim-
mer about 20 minutes. If necessary to heat the beans in the cans,
the bacon may be simmered separately and added after the cans are
opened.

150. Beans, string or snap, fresh

26 pounds beans, string or snnp, 8 pounds bacon, sliced

fresh

Cut off tips, then break the beans into pieces about 1 inch, wash
and place in a closed boiler with sufficient water to one-third cover
them. Then add the bacon and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Simmer for 1 hour, adding more water or beef stock, if necessary to
barely keep the beans covered. Serve hot.

151. Beets, fresh, boiled

26 pounds beets

Clean the beets thoroughly but do not skin or cut off roots. Boil
until well done, then hold under a faucet of cold water and rub the
skins off with the hands and remove roots. Cut into slices or, if
young and tender, serve whole. Serve hot .with butter, cream sauce,
or gravy. While washing and cooking be careful not to break the
skins as to do so would cause bleeding.

If fresh beets are used, clean and boil until tender, then drain
and remove skins and roots. Cut the beets into thin slices or cubes.
Sift together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt, mix with the vinegar,
and boil this sauce 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent scorch-
ing. Add the butter and, when melted and stirred in, pour the sauce
over the beets which should be heated if cold. Let stand a few min-
utes to absorb the sweet-sour flavor of the sauce.

Serve alone as an additional vegetable, or with meats. If served
with meats, use one-half of this recipe.

154. Beets, pickled

30 pounds beets 2 quarts vinegar

Boil the beets until done, then rub the skins off under cold water
with the hand, cut into ^-inch slices, and season with salt and
vinegar. If desired, 1 pound of sugar may be added to the vinegar.
Allow them to stand about 5 hours before serving.

155. Cabbage

When preparing cabbage, take off dead and dry outer leaves. Slice
about Y 2 inch off the stalk of each head and place the head in cool
fresh water, being sure that stem end is immersed in the water for
several hours. The cabbage will take up water through the stem
as a flower would, and become cool and crisp. Cabbage should never
be overcooked until it assumes a tan color. Cooked cabbage should
always retain the natural green color. It should be cooked only long
enough to make it tender. This requires only about 20 minutes for
boiled cabbage. Always boil in an open kettle, as this allows strong
odors to escape.

156. Cabbage, bavarian

35 pounds cabbage 1% quarts vinegar

4 pounds salt pork or bacon

Strip off outer leaves and remove the cores; cut into fine shreds,
wash and soak, and place in a boiler containing the pork or bacon,
vinegar, and 2 gallons of water. Season with salt and pepper. Boil
rapidly in an open boiler for about 20 minutes, adding boiling water,
if necessary, to keep covered. Then thicken slightly with a flour
batter and boil for about 5 minutes longer. Serve hot.

liquid, then a portion of the sifted dry ingredients, stirring well.
Continue until the dry ingredients are thoroughly mixed in, reg-
ulating quantity of liquid to make a thick batter which will just
drop off the spoon. A thin batter makes a poor product. Using
a large basting spoon, drop spoonfuls into hot fat and fry until
brown. There are two methods of frying : In hot fat about inch

deep; or in fat deep enough to cover the fritters. Serve hot with
sirup.

203. Sauerkraut, how made

30 pounds cabbage, trimmed 1 pound salt

Remove outer green leaves and slice the cabbage fine. Place in a
barrel a layer of cabbage (about 12 inches) and sprinkle salt over
it, then mash with a wooden masher until mushy. Add other layers
of cabbage and salt until the barrel is full. After the barrel is filled,
cover the kraut with a clean cloth and then with a board prepared
to fit snugly inside of the barrel. The board should be placed on the
cloth and a 100-pound rock on the board w'hile the cabbage is fer-
menting. Let stand in a temperature of about 70° F. for 1 month.
If the kraut is made in warm weather, the amount of salt used must be
increased by ^ pound. In warm weather the ripening process will
be faster than in cold weather. When the kraut is ready for use it
will have a decided odor, but when not fully matured it will have an
odor somewhat resembling that of beer. The temperature of the
place where it is stored has much to do with the acidity acquired in
any given time. Each time wlien removing kraut from the barrel,
thoroughly wash cloth, barrel cover, weigh, and sides of barrel, be-
fore replacing. This should be done once every week whether kraut is
removed or not. Care should be exercised in the selection of a barrel

Whip the sugar, fat, extract, and salt to a cream and beat in the
eggs slowly. Sift together the flour, corn meal, and baking powder,
and add to the creamed mixture with sufficient water to make a stiff
batter. Bake in a medium oven (325°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts) for
about 30 minutes. This cake may be made in different forms using
muffin pans as well as bakepans. Serve hot with butter, jam, jelly,
or sirup.

water.

Cream the fat and sugar and flavoring extract. Sift together the
flour, baking powder, and cinnamon three times and add this and the
fruit to the creamed mixture with the milk. Water may be used in
place of the milk, but does not make as good a cake. Stir well and
bake about 40 minutes in a moderate oven (250°-32.5° F. g 16 to 18
counts) . Serve plain or iced. This recipe produces a fairly palatable
cake which can be made from items included in the field ration, or
when eggs are not available.

beat in the eggs. Add the remaining flour. When the flour is about
half mixed in the batter, add the dredged fruit and spices and continue
mixing until the fruit is evenly distributed and the mixture smooth.
This mixture makes 35 pounds of cake.

The best results are obtained by baking fruit cake in an earthen
crock. If this is not available it may be baked in a pan. Fruit cake
requires a long, slow process of baking. From 3 to 6 hours in a slow
oven (200°-250° F. g 18 to 20 counts) are required.


221. Cake, marble

Same ingredients as for cake, white, with added coloring. After
the batter is mixed it should be divided into halves or thirds according
to the number of colors desired. One portion should be left white,
the other portion or portions should be colored as follows :

Chocolate . g Add 8 ounces cocoa or 6 ounces melted plain chocolate
and stir well.

Pink.^ redr., orange., etc. g These, or other desired colors, may be
obtained by adding prepared commercial vegetable colorings until the
desired color is reached.

After the different portions are colored they are combined, stirring
only enough to make a pleasing combination of colors.

and nutmeg together and add to the mixture. Mix or knead thor-
oughly, put in a bakepan, and set aside for about 1 hour, preferably
in a temperature of 80° F. At the end of this time, the cake should
be light and about double in height. Bake in a medium oven (325°-
400° F. g 12 to 16 counts) for about 30 minutes, or until done. Cool
before removing from the pan. This cake will be improved in

into the creamed fat-sugar-egg mixture. Sift together the flour, bak-
ing powder, and salt three times, and add gradually, with the milk,
to the creamed mixture in such proportions as to make mixing easy.
Beat the egg whites until stiff, and fold carefully into the batter.
Bake in a medium oven (352°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts) for 40 min-
utes if made in the form of a loaf cake, or 25 minutes if made into
cupcakes. Keep the oven as near 375° F, as possible throughout the
baking. Serve plain or with icing.

the yolks, and beat well to thoroughly mix. Add the boiling water,
beating continuously. Add the flour-and-sugar mixture slowly and
mix thoroughly. Sift the salt and cream of tartar over the egg
whites and beat until the whites are stiff. Add the extract to the
whites and mix with the yolk mixture. Bake for 1 hour at 300°

Cream together the sugar, fat, eggs, and flavoring extract, adding
one ingredient at a time in the order given. The flour, baking
powder, and salt should be sifted together twice and added grad-
ually. Add a part of the milk from time to time as needed to
make the mixing easy. If mixed in a mechanical mixer, the beating
operation should be at second speed. When all the milk is added
there should be a stiff batter. If too stiff, more milk or water may
be added. This may be baked in round pans for layer cake or in
large pans for shortcake. If used for layer cake use two to four
layers to form a cake when cool enough to handle and spread any
desired filling between layers. Cover top and sides with same filling

If fresh pumpkin or squash is used, prepare and cook as in squash,
mashed ; if canned, cooking is not necessary. Place cooked or canned
pumpkin or squash in a large bowl or container. The pumpkin or
.squash must be smooth but not watery (if w^atery, heat until water
has evaporated). Mix sugar, salt, spices, and milk with the pump-
kin or squash. Beat the eggs and stir into the mixture and pour
into unbaked pie shells. Bake in a quick oven (400°-450® F. g
9 to 12 counts) for the first 20 minutes, then lower to a slow oven
( 200°-2r»0° F. g 18 to 20 counts) and continue for 40 minutes longer.
When completely baked, the filling is firm and does not stick to a
knife blade, and the edge of the crust is a golden brown. If the
filling shrinks unduly, it was too moist.

253. Prunes, stewed

7 pounds prunes 3 lemons, sliced thin

:&gt; pounds sugar

Wash prunes. Cover with cold water; bring to a boil and cook
until tender (30 to 50 minutes). Add sugar and lemon for last 5
minutes of cooking. Remove from fire; add water to replace that
which has evaporated. Let stand overnight. Serve cold.

stewed, or 25 pounds of fresh apples, 7 poun&lt;ls sugar
stewed and diced or 2 cans apples 4 ounces cinnamon
(No. 10 cans)

Slice and toast the bread and spread in the bottom of a well-
greased bakepan, then spread a layer of the apples over the toast
and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon; continue alternate layers of
toast and apples until the pan is filled. Bake in a medium oven
(325°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts) about 20 minutes and serve with a
plain or caramel sauce. Nearly any kind of fresh or dried fruit may
be used and the pudding named accordingly.

Soak the bread in the milk. Season with sugar and cinnamon,
add raisins and beaten eggs, mix, and spread about 1 inch deep in
pan. Over this spread about 1 inch of fruit stewed (if dried) then
another layer of the bread mixture. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon
over the top layer. Bake about 40 minutes in a medium oven (325°-
400° F. g 12 to 16 counts). Serve hot or cold with cream or sweet
sauce. This makes an excellent dish and gives an opportunity to use
available scrap bread. Shredded coconut may be used to improve
the flavor.

Dissolve the cornstarch in 5 quarts of cold water, then add 5
gallons of boiling water, the sugar, salt, and milk. Cook for 5 min-
utes, cool, and add the extract. This pudding is improved by dis-
solving the cornstarch in 5 quarts of milk instead of cold water and
the addition of four eggs to each gallon of pudding made. It should
never be served plain; various fruits, coconut, etc., should be added.
Pour into vegetable dishes and when cool place in the ice box. Serve
with milk or sweet sauce.

simmer until clear (until the “pearls” have disappeared) which will
require about 1 hour ; then beat or whip in the fruit, sugar, beaten eggs,
and extract while hot. Raisins, currants, or other fruit may be added.

If quick (granulated) tapioca is used, no soaking is required. Add
tapioca to cold water and bring to the simmering point. In about 15
or 20 minutes the granules of tapioca will have disappeared. Then
add other ingredients as shown for pearl tapioca.

Serve hot or cold with milk or a sweet sauce.

SWEET DOUGH PRODUCTS

tity of coffee cake, etc. Therefore, one basic sweet dough is sufficient
for 100 men. For 200 men, use two basic sweet doughs; for 50 men
use one-half of one basic sweet dough, etc.

Straight-dough method . g Cream thoroughly the sugar, salt, fat, and
spice, then add eggs gradually and cream until light. Add flavoring
extract. Dissolve the yeast in one-fourth of the milk which should
be at a temperature of about 80° F. Add remainder of milk to the
creamed mass and stir thoroughly to dissolve all ingredients. Add
hard flour and begin mixing. Pour on yeast solution, add soft flour,
and continue mixing until the dough is smooth and free from lumps.
This dough should be slacker than ordinary bread dough. Begulate
water or milk to have a dough not too slack to handle. Set to rise
in temperature of about 80° F. and cover with cloth. Allow to fer-
ment (rise) until dough around impressions made by moderate pres-
sure of two fingers starts to recede, then give first punch. The first
rise requires about hours. In hot weather, or when it is impossible
to keep the temperature of the dough down to 80° F., it is best to
punch the dough young, about 45 minutes after mixing, as overfermen-
tation ruins sweet dwngh more than any other factor. After punching,
allow to stand 15 or 20 minutes, then work into desired forms. Cover
dough not being worked to prevent crusting.

Comments . g The addition of 4 ounces of baker’s malt, when avail-
able, to the above ingredients will improve the dough. All hard flour
may be used if soft flour is not available. In such case substitute 1V2
pounds cornstarch for an equal amount of flour.

This is a yeast-raised dough to which additional sugar may be added
after fermentation. It is usually enriched by the addition of eggs,
spices, butter, citron, lemon peel, raisins, nuts, etc., and is manipulated
into desired forms. It may be made by the straight-dough or sponge
methods. The sponge method (given below) is used when speed
- is essential.

If the dough must be handled in a cold room, some means should be
found to keep the temperature around 80° F. The dough may be
placed in a suitable vessel and this vessel placed in a fireless cooker
or into a larger container lined with sacks or hay. Close the top of
larger container and keep in a warm place, if possible.

At least 50 different forms of cakes, rolls, buns, etc., may be made
from this sweet dough. This is done by taking the desired quantity
of the sweet dough for the product to be made, adding such additional
quantities of sugar, butter, eggs, fruits, citron, lemon peel, nuts, etc.,
as desired for richness, and working into desired form.

Quick sponge method . g Dissolve all the yeast (^ pound) in 1 pint
of the liquid. Dissolve all the sugar (1 pound) in 1 pint of the liquid.

Pour the dissolved yeast over 3 pounds of the hard flour and mix
slightly. Pour the dissolved sugar into the mixture and mix well.
Set to stand in a warm place (about 90° F.) . This will become spongy
in about 20 minutes, hence the name “sponge.” As soon as it has become
light and spongy, put it into a mixing bowl, add remainder of liquid,
and stir well to break up the sponge. Then cream the salt, fat, spice,
and eggs, and add flavoring extract as for the straight-dough method.
Add the cream mixture and stir well, then add remainder of flour and
mix thoroughly. Allow to rest about 5 minutes and then commence
working into the desired form.

265. Cake, apple

15 pounds apples, fresh, or 2 cans ap- 1 pound fat (butter, lard, or lard sub-
pies (No. 10 cans) stitute)

1 basic sweet dough 1 pound raisins

1 pound sugar

Make in the same manner as coffee cake but place thin slices of
cooked, fresh, or canned apples over top of dough about 30 mimites
before baking. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and raisins if
desired, and bake in medium oven (325°-400° F. g 12 to 16 counts)
about 30 minutes. Avoid too much heat, as this may cause the fruit
to become dry, or very ripe fruit to become mushy. Almost any
kind of fruit may be used instead of apples. Bring edges of dough
up around the side of the pan so as to retain fruit juice.

266. Cake, coffee


1 basic sweet dough 1 pound fat (butter, lard, or lard sub-

1 pound sugar stitute)

1 pound raisins


Work all other ingredients thoroughly into the sweet dough, roll
out about Y 2 inch thick, and place in any kind of pan available.
Allow to rise at 80° F. for about 30 minutes, or until the dough
has about doubled in size. Bake in medium oven (325°-400° F.-12
to 16 counts) 20 to 30 minutes, or until done. To determine when
baked, raise edge to see whether under side is done. After baking,
cool and add plain icing or, instead of icing, sprinkle top with sugar
and cinnamon just before placing in oven.

Mix all other ingredients with the basic sweet dough, then let
rise for 20 minutes in a temperature of 80° F. Roll out into sheets
about inch thick and cut with doughnut cutter or form into Tarious
shapes as desired. Let rise again until about double in size, and fry in
deep fat at 365° to 370° F. Too stiff a mixture may cause the dough-
nuts to crack while frying.

After frying, drain and sprinkle with powdered sugar mixed with
a small quantity of cinnamon. Icing may be used.

268. Doughnuts, jelly

1 can Jelly (No. 10 ’can) 3 ounces yeast, compressed

1 basic sweet dough % ounce mace, ground

3 pounds flour % ounce lemon extract

% ounce salt Water sufficient to make a slack dough

Same as for doughnuts but instead of cutting into doughnut shape,
cut off pieces of dough about 1^ ounces in weight and roll into a
ball. Make depression with thumb or any suitable instrument, drop
small quantity of jelly into this depression, and close by pinching
dough together. Let rise (or proof) about 30 minutes, then fry and
sugar in the same manner as for doughnuts.

269. Bolls, cinnamon

1 basic sweet dough 1 pound fat (butter, lard, or lard sub-

% pound sugar stitute)

6 ounces cinnamon

Roll the basic dough into sheets about ^ inch thick, 15 inches wide,
and convenient lengths. Brush with melted fat and sprinkle liberally
with sugar and cinnamon. Roll the sheet dough into a tight roll as a
cigarette and cut into ^-inch thick slices with a sharp knife. Place
close together in well-greased pans with cut sides, which have first
been sprinkled with sugar, up and down. Let rise until double in size
and bake in a medium oven (325°g 400° F.  12 to 16 counts) 30 to 40
minutes. Do not bake until hard. Move bakepans occasionally while
in the oven to insure being well baked on bottom. Turn out of pans
to prevent sticking. When cool, cover with uncooked icing if desired.

HOT BREADS

272. Biscuit, baking powder

16 pounds flour 6 cans milk, evaporated, diluted with

3 ounces salt 6 pints water, or 20 ounces powdered

11 ounces baking powder skim milk dissolved in 6 pints water

4 pounds fat (lard or lard substitute)

Sift the dry ingredients together three times and work in the fat.
Make a well in the middle and add all the milk at once. Stir until
mixed. This should make a soft dough, if not, add more milk.
Turn out on lightly floured board and knead, quickly for not more
than 1 minute. The secret of making good biscuit is in handling
the dough only enough to mix thoroughly. Boll out to one-half the
thickness desired in the baked biscuit, cut out with a biscuit cutter,
and place in bakepans just touching each other. Bake in a quick
oven (400®g 450° F.  ^9 to 12 counts) for 12 minutes or until brown.
Serve hot.

ROLLS


278. Basic dough


10 pounds flour 13 ounces sugar

(iy 2 ounces yeast, compressed 13 ounces fat (lard or lard substitute)

&lt;5 pints water or milk 2% ounces salt

Dissolve the yeast in 2 pints of the water at a temperature of 80°
F. Dissolve the sugar and salt in remainder of water. Add this to
the flour and mix slightly. Add the dissolved yeast and the fat and
mix thoroughly. Regulate the quantity of liquid to make a soft
dough. Set to rise in a well-greased pan covered with a slightly
damp cloth. In cold weather, or if the kitchen is cold, it is well to
keep this cloth dampened with warm (not hot) water. If the tem-
perature of the room is about 80°, it is sufficient to allow the dough
to rise. Ferment and punch as for basic sweet dough. It is best to
work up this dough while it is still on the young side. Do not allow
it to overferment.

This dough makes rolls, etc., which are preferred by many to those
made from the basic sweet dough. It may be made into a variety
of rolls, as parkerhouse, sandwich buns, finger rolls, pan rolls, etc., or
may be used to make a raisin bread. It may also be used to make
plain bread which is superior for toast.

279. Cinnamon rolls


Use the basic dough and make up into cinnamon rolls as given in
recipe 269.

280. Finger rolls

Use the basic dough. Scale into 2-ounce pieces, using the method
shown in recipe 281 but cutting from 32-ounce pieces. Roll each piece
about twice in a circular motion (do not form into a complete ball),
then with the flat hand roll out into a cylinder or “snake” about
5 inches long. Endeavor to keep the ends square. It requires some
experience to make neat finger rolls. Then place the rolls well apart
on a well-greased bakepan, allow to proof (rise) until about double
in size, and bake about 15 minutes in a medium oven (325°-400° F. g
12 to 16 counts). These rolls are used for hot dogs and are good for
lunches in the field, on the target range, etc.

281. Fan rolls


Use the basic dough scaled into li^-ounce pieces. Scale off pieces
of dough weighing 24 ounces and roll out into “snakes” about 2 inches
in diameter. Double over and cut in half, repeat this with each half ;

this gives four pieces. Cut each of these in half; this gives eight
pieces. Cut each of these in half and the result is 16 pieces, each
weighing 1^^ ounces. This method is quick and with a little experi-
ence will give weights nearly enough accurate for practical purposes.
Bound up each piece into a neat ball and put close together in a well-
greased bakepan. Allow to proof (rise) until about double in size
and bake for about 15 minutes in a medium oven (325°-400° F. g
12 to 16 counts). Serve hot.

282. Parkerhouse rolls

Use the basic dough. Scale into 1^-ounce pieces as given in recipe
281. Bound into neat balls and allow to rest on the table, first sprink-
ling some dusting flour to prevent sticking to the table. By the time
the last of the dough has been rounded, the first pieces will be ready
for working into rolls. Place four of these pieces in a row. Use a
small rolling pin (a piece cut from a household size broomstick is the
proper size) and put a crease or dent in the middle of each piece. Then
brush across the creases with melted butter or a mixture of melted
butter and lard; then fold over, so that top fold is one-third shorter
than bottom fold. Seal the two folds together by pressing the top
lip, but do not apply enough pressure to knock down. Place in well-
greased bakepans about 2 inches apart, let proof (rise) until about
double in size, and bake in a medium oven (325®-400® F. g 12 to 16
counts). Serve hot with butter, jam, or jelly.

283. Baisin bread

Wash 4 pounds of raisins, dredge with flour, then add to the basic
dough when mixing. Then handle as for soft bun bread.

284. Soft bun bread

Use the basic dough and make up into loaves. If no individual
bread pans are on hand, scale into 35-ounce pieces, round, and let
rest until loose (about 20 minutes). Form into loaves and place six
of these in one black iron bakepan. Proof (rise) until just above
edge of pan and bake about 30 minutes in a medium oven (325°-400°
F. g 12 to 16 counts).

the bag to permit expansion of the coffee. Place the bag containing
the coffee in water, when water is slightly under boiling point, and
allow to simmer, not boil, for 10 to 12 minutes. Stir the bag occa-
sionally during the simmering period. Remove the bag. Serve at

THE ARMY COOK


Observe the following rules to insure good coffee :

a. Keep roasted and ground coffee in a container as airtight as
possible.

h. Carefully measure quantities of both water and coffee.

c. When grounds are removed from coffee, throw them away. Do
not use these grounds to make additional quantities of coffee, and do
not use part spent grounds and part unused grounds for subsequent
brews. Always use fresh (unused) ground coffee.

d. Be sure to bring water to a boil, but do not add coffee to water
until the water has cooled slightly below the boiling point.

e. Serve the coffee as soon as possible after completion of brew.
The brew should not be completed more than 16 minutes prior to time
of serving.

f. Scour the coffee boiler daily.

g. After removing grounds from muslin bag or sack, the sack
should be washed in lukewarm, not hot, water, thoroughly rinsed in
cold water, and then permitted to remain submerged in a pan of cold
water until ready to use again.

3l4. Lemonade

13 gallons ice water 100 lemons

7 pounds sugar 10 pounds Ice

Squeeze the juice from the lemons with a lemon squeezer and add
it to the water. Sweeten to taste with sugar and stir thoroughly

Suspend the tea from the top of the boiler in a muslin bag and
allow to stand in the hot water for 5 minutes. The bag should be
sufficiently large to give the tea plenty of room so that the boiling
water will penetrate all portions of it. Remove the bag of tea, stir
the beverage, and serve hot.

Iced tea . g ^Use 1 gallon of water and 15 ounces of tea and prepare
as for hot tea. Cool and just before serving add sufficient cold water

5. How to measure. g All measurements are level. Draw a knife
across tlie top of the measure when filled, so that the surface is level.

a. Mess kit cup or dipper . g To measure dry ingredients such as
granulated sugar and flour, fill cup or dipper to desired level, and
do not pack or shake. Flour should always be sifted once before
measuring. When shortening, such as butter or other fats is meas-
ured, it should be soft enough to pack, if cup or dipper is to be
completely filled. In measuring a lumpy product, break up lumps
before measuring.

h, T ahlespoon . g To measure dry ingredients or shortening by table-
sj)Oon, fill to overflowing and level with straight edge of knife. To
divide in half, fill and level, and divide lengthwise with a knife.
For quarters, cut another line directly across the center of the first one.

Note. g It must be remembered that an oven count will vary according to the
individual and also vary as the hand of the person making the count is sensi-
tive or insensitive to heat. This is affected by the occupation of the man making
the count. Cooks and others accustomed to working in heat are able to keep
their hands in a hot oven longer than persons not accustomed to heat. There-
fore, the only absolutely accurate method of determining oven temperature is
by a thermometer. However, if no thermometer is available, the hand-second
method will give fairly satisfactory results.

h. Frying and deep-fat frying. g (1) Frying.  ^Frying means to
cook in a shallow layer of fat. It differs from pan-broiling in which
no fat is added, and is used for thin slices of round steak, veal steak
and chops, liver, and sometimes pork chops. Frying gives crispy
browned exterior and fine-flavored but less tender product than
braising.

(2) Method for frying'. g ^Dredge meat in flour, if desired. Season
with salt and pepper. Brown quickly on both sides in a small
amount of hot fat. Do not cover. Continue to cook at reduced
temperature until done.

(3) Deep- fat frying. g Deep-fat frying means to cook in a deep
layer of fat. It is not recommended for uncooked meat. It may
be a convenient method for browning breaded chops which have
been partially or wholly cooked before crumbing, and is often used
to finish cooking precooked chicken. It is used in preparation of
croquettes. Care should be taken to keep fat from smoking.

(&amp;) Do not add fat. Enough fat cooks out to grease pan.

{c) Brown well on both sides. This develops flavor and aroma.
{d) Season with salt and pepper.

{e) Beduce temperature; meat will be juicier. Prevents over-
browning.

(/) Do not cover or add water. The meat will braise, not broil, in
the presence of moisture. The aim in pan broiling is to get results
comparable to broiling.

{g) Turn occasionally. This insures even cooking.

(A) Pour off fat which collects in pan. Meat should broil, not fry.

(3) Cooking time. g {a) Definite times for pan broiling cannot be
given. The time is about the same as for broiling a cut of same
thickness.

runs over and through meat.

{d) Do not cover. Steam surrounds meat which is covered, mak-
ing it a pot roast.

{e) Roast at a constant, moderate temperature (325® F. g 16
counts). Searing does not keep in juices. Meat and gravy will be
nicely browned without initial sear. A moderate temperature reduces
shrinkage and increases flavor, juiciness, and tenderness.

(/) Do not add water. With a moderate temperature, drippings
will not burn.

{g) Roast until done. Time depends on kind of meat, degree of
doneness, and oven temperature. A meat thermometer is the most
accurate way to tell when roast is done.

(2) Iloxc to make stew. g («) Have meat cut in small cubes. A
j boneless stew is more attractive than one with bones. Avoid bone
' splinters by avoiding use of cleaver, if stew meat is not boneless.

(ft) Season with salt and pepper. The salt will penetrate small
]&gt;ieces, so is best put in at start of cooking.

(c) If desired, brown on all .sides in hot fat. A browned stew has
more meat flavor than a light stew.

{d) Cover with water. The water need not be boiling as hot water
! does not seal in juices any more than searing. ISIeat should be
^ covered by water so that all will be cooked at same temperature,
i (e) Cover kettle.

(/) Cook at a simmering temperature (18.5°-200° F.) until tender
(about 2 to 21/^ hours). Meat will be stringy and tasteless if boiled.

(r/) Add vegetables just long enough before meat is tender so that
they Avill be done, but not overcooked. Vegetables should be uniform
in size.

(2) How to cook in water. g (a) Cover meat with water. The
water need not be hot since boiling water does not seal in juices.
The meat should be entirely covered so that all of meat will cook at
same temperature.

(6) Season with salt and pepper, except smoked pork cuts and
corned beef. Cloves, peppercorns, bayleaf, or flavor vegetables may
be added.

(&lt;?) Cover and cook at simmering temperature until meat is tender.
Never boil because the connective tissue will be dissolved and the
meat hard to carve; also, shrinkage will be greater and meat will
be dry and tasteless.

{d) If vegetables, such as potatoes, onions, or cabbage, are cooked
in kettle with meat they should be put in just long enough before
meat is done for them to be tender. Overcooking vegetables gives
them a poor texture and strong flavor.

(2) Suggestions for using grownd meat. g (a) Loaf .  Meat loaf is
roasted like any tender cut in a moderate oven (350° F.). A loaf
weighing 2% pounds will take V/^, to 2 hours.

1. The loaf may be made from one kind of meat or of two or

more kinds. Good combinations are g

1 part fresh pork to 3 parts lean beef.

1 part smoked ham to 3 parts veal.

1 part salt pork to 10 parts veal.

1 part fresh, lean pork to 2 parts smoked ham.

2. Liver may be used for loaf. The slices should be dropped

in boiling water for a few’ minutes before grinding.

3. Ground lamb makes a good loaf, alone or with beef, pork,

or veal.

Ji. Meat should be ground medium fine; too fine a grind makes
the loaf too compact ; if too coarse, the connective tissue
is easily detected.

6. Seasoned meat may be shaped into a loaf and roasted or may
be extended by the use of bread crumbs, mashed potatoes,
or cereals.

6. If bread crumbs are dry, they should be moistened with water,

milk, or tomato juice.

7. If the proportion of “extenders” is higher, a thick white sauce

or eggs should be added as a binder.

(&amp;) Patties. g Ground meat, with or without an “extender” may be
shaped into patties usually about 1 inch thick. These are cooked by
pan broiling or frying.

Salisbury steak is ground beef, seasoned only with salt and pepper
and pan broiled on a lightly greased griddle.

{c) Variety.

f 1. Individual patties may be wrapped in bacon.

2. Variety in flavor may be obtained by the use of different
seasonings: catsup, chili sauce, minced onion, mustard,
or horseradish.

, 3. Uncooked liver ground with cooked meat for hash gives

freshness.

12. Care and use of deep-fat fryers. g ^The fryers which have
/' been installed in some mess kitchens are constructed on a scientific
principle which practically assures good products. Heat is applied
above the bottom of the cooking vessel. This results in having hot fat
above and cold fat below. All sediment and particles drop into the
; cold fat, thus preventing burning which would help to “break down”
fat. The thermostat should keep the fat at a constant temperature.
(Do not overload the fryer because this results in lowering the tem-
perature too much.)

а. Before using fryer. g Fill kettle with cleaning solution such as is
^ ' used in dishwashers. Set the thermostat to 250° F. Boil for 10 min-
utes. Kinse with clean hot water and dry thoroughly.

б. How much fat to use. g ^Fill with fat to a level just enough to cover
* food being fried. Heat slowly so that fat will not be scorched. Fat

. which is held at smoking point will become scorched.

c. Directions for frying. g ^When fat has reached the temperature

I indicated for the recipe being used, put food in the basket and lower

^ into fat. When browned, lift up basket, allow food to drain to re-

' move free melted fat, and then turn food onto brown wrapping or

I other paper which will absorb excess fat.

d. Fried foods in menus. g ^Fried foods are desirable only when they
are well cooked. Greasy, overcooked products are unappetizing and

slow to digest. Foods fried in deep fat should be a good color, crisp,
and palatable. Use temperatures and times given in the table below. *

Other foods which may be french fried are onions, french toast,
croutons, boiled sliced sweet potatoes, eggplant, cucumbers, and squash
which have been sliced and" dipped in batter.

e. How to deem fryer. g (1) The fat should be drained off into
kettle, strained through cheesecloth, or put to one side and allowed
to settle.

(2) Fill the frying pot with water, heat to boiling, and add from
3 ounces to 1 pound of good cleaning compound (depending on size
of fryer) .

(3) After boiling for about 25 minutes, shut the burner oflF and allow
to stand overnight, if possible.

(4) Drain and refill with water. Boil and drain.

(5) Refill with water, heat, and add from 2 tablespoonfuls to a
cup of vinegar, depending on the size of the fryer. Stir and allow to
stand a few minutes before draining. Refill with water and drain.

f. Reuse of fat. g Put strained fat in kettle and add fresh fat to
proper level. There should always be enough fat to allow the tem-
perature to remain reasonably constant.

Good care and intelligent use of a fryer insure its longer life and
better fried products.

or tallow, scrap or drippings, in 2 gallons of water. As soon as all
the fat is melted add about % pint of the dissolved lye. Boil over
a slow fire. Taste from time to time until the biting taste of the soap
liquid has disappeared. Ad&lt;l water to replace that boiled away.
Add another i/4 pint of lye as before and continue boiling, tasting, and
adding lye and water in the same manner until the lye is consumed.
The liquid will then become like lioney in consistency and will be
transparent as it drops from a spoon. Add about ^ pound of salt.
Boil until the soap separates from the lye water, has lost its honey-
like appearance, and drops off a spoon or wooden paddle like greasy
water. A small quantity pressed between the thumb and first finger
will not feel greasy but will flatten into thin scales if the soap is
finished. Simmer about 10 minutes and the piwess is complete.
Skim off the soap which floats on the surface, place in a suitable mold
or molds, and set aside to harden.

&amp;. So/t Hoap . g Use 1 quart of the soap made according to the above
formula but not hardened. Boil in a large kettle with 4 gallons of
water until clear and uniform in appeaiance. Set aside to cool.

c. Impecfion of map. g (1) Cut a piece of soap in two and place
the tongue on the fresh surface.

(«) If the soap is very sharp to the taste, not enough grease has
been used.

(ft) If the soap feels very greasy, too much grease has been used.

(c) If the soap tastes sharp and also feels gi'easy, it has not been
mixed or boiled properly.

(2) A soap that is sharp to the taste and makes a good lather is
much prefei red for scrubbing purposes.

d. If the hard soap in process of setting is slightly soft and it ap-
pears that it will not hai*den, this difficulty may be overcome by at-
taching a short piece of rubber hose to the spout of an ordinary
teakettle and placing the other end of the hose in the bottom of the
soap kettle, thus introducing steam. In this way heat is obtained
by using wet steam instead of the heat being applied to the bottom
of the kettle. Available steam may also be drawn from boilers in
lieu of the kettle method. A drier mixture and a harder soap result.

14. Window washing. g For efficient and economical window
washing, to gallons of water add 1 tablespoonful of kerosene.
Dampen a soft cloth in this mixture and use for cleaning. Then rub
with a dry cloth which polishes as well as dries the window. When
the drying cloth becomes old and worn it may be used as a washing
cloth and replaced by a fresh one. When long, high windows are
involved, and it is impracticable to wash by hand, the cloth may

be attached to a handle with a cross bar at the end, similar to a squee-
gee. (The squeegee is simply a handle and a cross bar at the end, into
which has been pressed a strip of hard rubber.) The use of the
squeegee is not recommended, as it does not dry the windows thor-
oughly and requires the use of a drying cloth afterward. The above
quantity of water and kerosene is usually sufficient for a day’s work,
but when the windows are very dirty or greasy a larger quantity is
necessary.

15. Separation and disposal of kitchen waste and garbage. g
a. Proper garbage separation and disposal is necessary from a sani-
tary standpoint and also where it is to be used later for animal food.
All kitchen waste and garbage not to be used by the organization
should be separated intog

(1) That which is suitable for animal food, as bread, meat scraps,
and vegetables.

(2) That which is not suitable for animal food, as coffee grounds,
eggshells, fruit rinds or skins, and also glass and tin containers,
waste paper, and ashes.

h. Containers used for garbage accumulation should have tight-
fitting covers and be leakproof. There are various kinds of housings
for garbage cans. They and the vicinity around them should be
kept clean.
